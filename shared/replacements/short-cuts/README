Purpose
--------

This folder contains small packages that provide commands for typesetting common 
mathematical expressions the way we like them 

For example, g-trig.sty provides commands for typesetting trigonomteric functions.
Ideally, each topic in maths should have its own .sty file. For example, one can 
imagine a dedicated pacakge for typesetting expressions in calculus 

Package and package file naming convention
-------------------------------------------
Well, TeX requires that if a package is called xyz, then its corresponding file be called xyz.sty.
So, we have no latitude there

However, within gradians, we will always have xyz of the form g-*.sty - where the 'g' prefix 
is for gradians. Hence, g-trig.sty or g-complex.sty 

\newcommand naming convention
------------------------------

1. Write commands in camel-case. Example: \fSumOfCos - not \f_sum_of_cos
2. If command is for typesetting expressions of the form LHS = RHS, then 
   a. Write 2 commands - one for typesetting the whole expression ( LHS = RHS )
      and the other for typesetting just the RHS 

   b. Command for typesetting the full expression *** must start with *** 'f'
      Example: \fSumOfCos

   c. Command for typesetting just the RHS expression *** must start with *** 'e'.
      Example: \eSumOfCos

Things to do after writing a NEW .sty file
-------------------------------------------
1. Include it by adding a \RequirePackage{g-whatever} command in tufte-exam.cls 
2. Test it locally:
   a. cp the new g-whatever.sty file into /usr/local/texlive/texmf-local/tex/latex/short-cuts/
   b. At the /usr/local/texlive level, issue the following command - mktexlsr .
   c. Use some of the new commands provided by the new package in a question.tex. 
      ONLY IF it compiles successfully should you do (3)

3. Do (2) on Linode 

Things to do after editing an EXISTING .sty file
--------------------------------------------------

1. You do NOT need to run mktexlsr again. However, the edited file will have to be 
   copied into /usr/local/texlive/texmf-local/tex/latex/short-cuts/

2. Test changes locally first though
3. Only then do (1) on Linode
