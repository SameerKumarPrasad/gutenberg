This folder contains the LaTeX templates for various kinds of reports 
and documents that can be generated on request 

Broadly, these docs would either be report-cards OR of the "directory-listing"
type - like list of students, teachers etc 

Report cards can be of two types - CSV/XLS or TeX files. And they can be 
about anything. Basically, if you can imagine a question - like how
has a student done on a topic over time - then you can make a report-card for it
