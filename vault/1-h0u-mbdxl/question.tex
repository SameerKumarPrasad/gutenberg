% This is an empty shell file placed for you by the 'examiner' script.
% You can now fill in the TeX for your question here.

% Now, down to brasstacks. ** Writing good solutions is an Art **. 
% Eventually, you will find your own style. But here are some thoughts 
% to get you started: 
%
%   1. Write the solution as if you are writing it for your favorite
%      14-17 year old to help him/her understand. Could be your nephew, 
%      your niece, a cousin perhaps or probably even you when you 
%      were that age. Just write for them.
%
%   2. Use margin-notes to "talk" to students about the critical insights
%      in the question. The tone can be - in fact, should be - informal
%
%   3. Don't shy away from creating margin-figures you think will help
%      students understand. Yes, it is a little more work per question. 
%      But the question & solution will be written only once. Make that
%      attempt at writing a solution count.
%
%   4. At the same time, do not be too verbose. A long solution can
%      - at first sight - make the student think, "God, that is a lot to know".
%      Our aim is not to scare students. Rather, our aim should be to 
%      create many "Aha!" moments everyday in classrooms around the world
% 
%   5. Ensure that there are *no spelling mistakes anywhere*. We are an 
%      education company. Bad spellings suggest that we ourselves 
%      don't have any education. Also, use American spellings by default
% 
%   6. If a question has multiple parts, then first delete lines 40-41
%   7. If a question does not have parts, then first delete lines 43-69

\question[4] The figure alongside shows the plot of the curve $y=(x^2+2x)\cdot e^{-x}$.

\begin{solution}[\fullpage]
 \begin{align}
    (x^2+2x)\cdot e^{-x} &= x(x+2)\cdot e^{-x}
 \end{align}
 $\Rightarrow$ the curve cuts the $x-axis$ at $x=0$ and $x=-2$
 
 The required area $A$ of region $R$ is therefore
 \begin{align}
    A &= \int_{-2}^0(x^2+2x)e^{-x}\ud x \\
      &= \int_{-2}^0 (x^2\cdot e^{-x})\ud x + \int_{-2}^0 (2x\cdot e^{-x})\ud x
  \end{align}
  
  Setting $-x = z$, we get 
  \begin{align}
    A &= -\int_2^0(z^2\cdot e^z)\ud z + \int_2^0 (2z\cdot e^z)\ud z \\
      &= \int_0^2(z^2\cdot e^z)\ud z + \int_2^0 (2z\cdot e^z)\ud z \\
      &= \underbrace{\left[ (e^{z}z^2)_0^2 - \int_0^2 e^{z}(2z)\ud z \right]}_{\texttt{integration by parts}}
      + \int_2^0 (2z\cdot e^z)\ud z \\
      &= \left( e^{z}z^2 \right)_0^2 + 4\cdot\int_2^0 ze^{z}\ud z \\
      &= 4e^4 + 4\cdot\left( e^{z}(z-1)\right)_2^0 \\
      &= 4e^2 + 4\cdot(-1-e^2) \\
      &= -4
 \end{align}
 As area cannot be negative, we simply take the absolute value of the calculated integral.
 And hence, the required area $A = 4$ units
\end{solution}
