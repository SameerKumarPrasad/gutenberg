% Now, down to brasstacks. ** Writing good solutions is an Art **. 
% Eventually, you will find your own style. But here are some thoughts 
% to get you started: 
%
%   1. Write the solution as if you are writing it for your favorite
%      14-17 year old to help him/her understand. Could be your nephew, 
%      your niece, a cousin perhaps or probably even you when you 
%      were that age. Just write for them.
%
%   2. Use margin-notes to "talk" to students about the critical insights
%      in the question. The tone can be - in fact, should be - informal
%
%   3. Don't shy away from creating margin-figures you think will help
%      students understand. Yes, it is a little more work per question. 
%      But the question & solution will be written only once. Make that
%      attempt at writing a solution count.
%
%   4. At the same time, do not be too verbose. A long solution can
%      - at first sight - make the student think, "God, that is a lot to know".
%      Our aim is not to scare students. Rather, our aim should be to 
%      create many "Aha!" moments everyday in classrooms around the world
% 
%   5. Ensure that there are *no spelling mistakes anywhere*. We are an 
%      education company. Bad spellings suggest that we ourselves 
%      don't have any education. And, use American spellings

\question[2]  A necklace is appraised at \texteuro 6,300. If the value of
\insertQR{QRC}
the necklace has increased 7\% year-on-year, then how much was it worth 
10 years back?

\calculator{1.07^5=1.4, 1.89^{-1}=0.53, 1.96^{-1}=0.51, 1.78^{-1}=0.56} 

\ifprintanswers
  % stuff to be shown only in the answer key - like explanatory margin figures
\fi 

\begin{solution}[\mcq]
	\begin{align}
		P_{\texttt{now}} &= P_{\texttt{10 years back}}\cdot\left( 1 + \dfrac{7}{100}\right)^{10} \\
		\Rightarrow P_{\texttt{10 years back}} &= \dfrac{\text{\texteuro 6,300}}{(1.07)^{10}} \\
		&= \text{\texteuro} 3,202.60
	\end{align}
\end{solution}
