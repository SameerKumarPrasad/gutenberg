% This is an empty shell file placed for you by the 'examiner' script.

% Now, down to brasstacks. ** Writing good solutions is an Art **. 
% Eventually, you will find your own style. But here are some thoughts 
% to get you started: 
%
%   1. Write the solution as if you are writing it for your favorite
%      14-17 year old to help him/her understand. Could be your nephew, 
%      your niece, a cousin perhaps or probably even you when you 
%      were that age. Just write for them.
%
%   2. Use margin-notes to "talk" to students about the critical insights
%      in the question. The tone can be - in fact, should be - informal
%
%   3. Don't shy away from creating margin-figures you think will help
%      students understand. Yes, it is a little more work per question. 
%      But the question & solution will be written only once. Make that
%      attempt at writing a solution count.
%
%   4. At the same time, do not be too verbose. A long solution can
%      - at first sight - make the student think, "God, that is a lot to know".
%      Our aim is not to scare students. Rather, our aim should be to 
%      create many "Aha!" moments everyday in classrooms around the world
% 
%   5. Ensure that there are *no spelling mistakes anywhere*. We are an 
%      education company. Bad spellings suggest that we ourselves 
%      don't have any education. And, use American spellings

\begin{solution}[\halfpage]
  For the short solution, one should note that $\angle BAC = \dfrac{1}{2}\angle BOC$,
  where $\angle BOC = \ang{360} - \angle BOA - \angle AOC = \ang{160} \Rightarrow \angle BAC = \ang{80}$

	Alternatively, if we join $A$ with $B$ and $A$ with $C$ as shown, then we get two isoceles 
	triangles, $\triangle AOB$ and $\triangle AOC$
	
	In $\triangle AOB$,
	\begin{align}
		\angle OBA = \angle OAB &= \dfrac{1}{2}\cdot(\ang{180}-\angle AOB) \\
		                        &= \ang{50}
	\end{align}
	
	Similarly, in $\triangle AOC$
	\begin{align}
		\angle OAC = \angle OCA &= \dfrac{1}{2}\cdot(\ang{180}-\angle AOC) \\
		                        &= \ang{30}
	\end{align}
	
	And therefore,
	\begin{align}
		\angle BAC &= \angle OAB + \angle OAC \\
		           &= \ang{50} + \ang{30} = \ang{80}
	\end{align}

\end{solution}
