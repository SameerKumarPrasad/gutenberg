% Now, down to brasstacks. ** Writing good solutions is an Art **. 
% Eventually, you will find your own style. But here are some thoughts 
% to get you started: 
%
%   1. Write the solution as if you are writing it for your favorite
%      14-17 year old to help him/her understand. Could be your nephew, 
%      your niece, a cousin perhaps or probably even you when you 
%      were that age. Just write for them.
%
%   2. Use margin-notes to "talk" to students about the critical insights
%      in the question. The tone can be - in fact, should be - informal
%
%   3. Don't shy away from creating margin-figures you think will help
%      students understand. Yes, it is a little more work per question. 
%      But the question & solution will be written only once. Make that
%      attempt at writing a solution count.
%
%   4. At the same time, do not be too verbose. A long solution can
%      - at first sight - make the student think, "God, that is a lot to know".
%      Our aim is not to scare students. Rather, our aim should be to 
%      create many "Aha!" moments everyday in classrooms around the world
% 
%   5. Ensure that there are *no spelling mistakes anywhere*. We are an 
%      education company. Bad spellings suggest that we ourselves 
%      don't have any education. Also, use American spellings by default
% 
%   6. If a question has multiple  parts, then first delete lines 40-41
%   7. If a question does not have parts, then first delete lines 43-69

\question The number of terms of a geometric progression is even. Prove that the ratio of the sum of all the terms in the series to the sum of odd terms is $(r+1)$.

\begin{solution}
  Let the common ration of the progression be $r$ and the total number of terms be $n(even)$. The progression comprising only the odd terms would have common ration $r^2$ and number of terms $n/2$. \\
  \begin{align}
    S_{full} &= a\dfrac{r^n-1}{r-1} \\
    S_{odd}  &= a\dfrac{{r^2}^{n/2}-1}{r^2-1}
  \end{align}
  Let the ratio of the sums of series be $R$.
  \begin{align}
    R &= \dfrac{S_{full}}{S_{odd}} \\
      &= \dfrac{a\dfrac{r^n-1}{r-1}}{a\dfrac{{r^2}^{n/2}-1}{r^2-1}} \\
      &= \dfrac{r^n-1}{r-1}\dfrac{(r-1)(r+1)}{r^n-1} \\
      &= r + 1
  \end{align}
  Therefore, for any common ration $r$, the sum of all terms in the series is $r+1$ times the sum of the odd terms.
\end{solution}
