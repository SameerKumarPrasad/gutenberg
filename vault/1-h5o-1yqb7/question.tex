% Now, down to brasstacks. ** Writing good solutions is an Art **. 
% Eventually, you will find your own style. But here are some thoughts 
% to get you started: 
%
%   1. Write the solution as if you are writing it for your favorite
%      14-17 year old to help him/her understand. Could be your nephew, 
%      your niece, a cousin perhaps or probably even you when you 
%      were that age. Just write for them.
%
%   2. Use margin-notes to "talk" to students about the critical insights
%      in the question. The tone can be - in fact, should be - informal
%
%   3. Don't shy away from creating margin-figures you think will help
%      students understand. Yes, it is a little more work per question. 
%      But the question & solution will be written only once. Make that
%      attempt at writing a solution count.
%
%   4. At the same time, do not be too verbose. A long solution can
%      - at first sight - make the student think, "God, that is a lot to know".
%      Our aim is not to scare students. Rather, our aim should be to 
%      create many "Aha!" moments everyday in classrooms around the world
% 
%   5. Ensure that there are *no spelling mistakes anywhere*. We are an 
%      education company. Bad spellings suggest that we ourselves 
%      don't have any education. Also, use American spellings by default
% 
%   6. If a question has multiple parts, then first delete lines 40-41
%   7. If a question does not have parts, then first delete lines 43-69

\begin{solution}[\halfpage]
	\begin{fullwidth}
	\begin{align}
		2\cos^2 x + 3\sin x &= 2\cdot(1-\sin^2 x) + 3 \sin x = 0 \\
		&\Rightarrow 2\sin^2 x - 3\sin x - 2 = 0 \\
		&\Rightarrow \sin x = \dfrac{3 \pm \sqrt{3^2 - 4\cdot 2 \cdot (-2)}}{2\cdot2} = 2 \text{ or } -\dfrac{1}{2}
	\end{align}
	$\sin x > 1$ is not possible. Hence, the only feasible solution is $\sin x = -\dfrac{1}{2}$
	
	\begin{align}
		\text{And so, if } \sin x = -\dfrac{1}{2}, \text{ then } x &= n\pi + (-1)^n\cdot\left(-\dfrac{\pi}{6}\right) \\
		    &= n\pi + (-1)^{n+1}\left( \dfrac{\pi}{6}\right)
	\end{align}
	\end{fullwidth}
\end{solution}
