% Now, down to brasstacks. ** Writing good solutions is an Art **. 
% Eventually, you will find your own style. But here are some thoughts 
% to get you started: 
%
%   1. Write the solution as if you are writing it for your favorite
%      14-17 year old to help him/her understand. Could be your nephew, 
%      your niece, a cousin perhaps or probably even you when you 
%      were that age. Just write for them.
%
%   2. Use margin-notes to "talk" to students about the critical insights
%      in the question. The tone can be - in fact, should be - informal
%
%   3. Don't shy away from creating margin-figures you think will help
%      students understand. Yes, it is a little more work per question. 
%      But the question & solution will be written only once. Make that
%      attempt at writing a solution count.
%
%   4. At the same time, do not be too verbose. A long solution can
%      - at first sight - make the student think, "God, that is a lot to know".
%      Our aim is not to scare students. Rather, our aim should be to 
%      create many "Aha!" moments everyday in classrooms around the world
% 
%   5. Ensure that there are *no spelling mistakes anywhere*. We are an 
%      education company. Bad spellings suggest that we ourselves 
%      don't have any education. And, use American spellings

\question[3] If your aim is to get \texteuro 115 from an initial investment 
of \texteuro 100, then for how many months would you have to keep
your money invested in each of the following two banks?
\begin{table}
	\begin{tabular}{lcc}
		\toprule
		& Bank A & Bank B \\
		\midrule
		Interest (annualized) & 10\% & 9\% \\
		Compounding & half-yearly & monthly \\
		Time (months) & ? & ? \\
		\bottomrule
	\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\fi 

\begin{solution}
	For Bank A,
	\begin{align}
		\dfrac{\text{\texteuro 115}}{\text{\texteuro 100}} &= \left(1+\dfrac{0.1}{2}\right)^{N_A} \\
		\Rightarrow N_A &= \dfrac{\log 1.15}{\log 1.05} \\
		                &= 2.865\text{ half-years} = 2.865\times\text{6 months} \\
		                &= 17.19\text{ months}
	\end{align}
	
	Similarly, for Bank B,
	\begin{align}
		\dfrac{\text{\texteuro 115}}{\text{\texteuro 100}} &= \left(1+\dfrac{0.09}{12}\right)^{N_B} \\
		\Rightarrow N_B &= \dfrac{\log 1.15}{\log 1.0075} \\
		                &= 18.705\text{ months}
	\end{align}
	
	
\end{solution}
