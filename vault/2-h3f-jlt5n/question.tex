% This is an empty shell file placed for you by the 'examiner' script.
% You can now fill in the TeX for your question here.

% Now, down to brasstacks. ** Writing good solutions is an Art **. 
% Eventually, you will find your own style. But here are some thoughts 
% to get you started: 
%
%   1. Write the solution as if you are writing it for your favorite
%      14-17 year old to help him/her understand. Could be your nephew, 
%      your niece, a cousin perhaps or probably even you when you 
%      were that age. Just write for them.
%
%   2. Use margin-notes to "talk" to students about the critical insights
%      in the question. The tone can be - in fact, should be - informal
%
%   3. Don't shy away from creating margin-figures you think will help
%      students understand. Yes, it is a little more work per question. 
%      But the question & solution will be written only once. Make that
%      attempt at writing a solution count.
%
%   4. At the same time, do not be too verbose. A long solution can
%      - at first sight - make the student think, "God, that is a lot to know".
%      Our aim is not to scare students. Rather, our aim should be to 
%      create many "Aha!" moments everyday in classrooms around the world
% 
%   5. Ensure that there are *no spelling mistakes anywhere*. We are an 
%      education company. Bad spellings suggest that we ourselves 
%      don't have any education. Also, use American spellings by default
% 
%   6. If a question has multiple parts, then first delete lines 40-41
%   7. If a question does not have parts, then first delete lines 43-69

\question[4] Find the sum of 20 terms of an arithmetic progression if its first term is 2 and seventh term is 20.

\begin{solution}[\halfpage]
  Let the progression have a common difference $d$. The seventh term is denoted as $a_7$.
  \begin{align}
    a_7 &= 2 + (7-1)d \\
    20  &= 2 + 6d \\
    d   &= 3 
  \end{align}
  Now that we know the common difference, let us go ahead and calculate the sum of 20 terms using the general formula for summation of an arithmetic progression,
  \begin{align}
    S_n    &= \dfrac{n}{2}(2a + (n-1)d) \\
    S_{20} &= \dfrac{20}{2}(2(2) + (20-1)3) \\
           &= 610
  \end{align}

\end{solution}
