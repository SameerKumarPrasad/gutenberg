% This is an empty shell file placed for you by the 'examiner' script.
% You can now fill in the TeX for your question here.

% Now, down to brasstacks. ** Writing good solutions is an Art **. 
% Eventually, you will find your own style. But here are some thoughts 
% to get you started: 
%
%   1. Write the solution as if you are writing it for your favorite
%      14-17 year old to help him/her understand. Could be your nephew, 
%      your niece, a cousin perhaps or probably even you when you 
%      were that age. Just write for them.
%
%   2. Use margin-notes to "talk" to students about the critical insights
%      in the question. The tone can be - in fact, should be - informal
%
%   3. Don't shy away from creating margin-figures you think will help
%      students understand. Yes, it is a little more work per question. 
%      But the question & solution will be written only once. Make that
%      attempt at writing a solution count.
%
%   4. At the same time, do not be too verbose. A long solution can
%      - at first sight - make the student think, "God, that is a lot to know".
%      Our aim is not to scare students. Rather, our aim should be to 
%      create many "Aha!" moments everyday in classrooms around the world
% 
%   5. Ensure that there are *no spelling mistakes anywhere*. We are an 
%      education company. Bad spellings suggest that we ourselves 
%      don't have any education. Also, use American spellings by default
% 
%   6. If a question has multiple parts, then first delete lines 40-41
%   7. If a question does not have parts, then first delete lines 43-69

\question A tower and a building stand opposite each other. If the angle of elevation
from the bottom of the tower to the top of the building is $\ang{30}$ and the angle
of elevation from the bottom of the building to the top of the tower is $\ang{60}$, then
what is the height of the building given that the tower is 50 meters tall

\begin{solution}
	The situation is \asif. And one can see that,
	
	\begin{align}
		AB = \dfrac{BN}{\tan\ang{60}} &= \dfrac{AM}{\tan\ang{30}} \\
		\Rightarrow \dfrac{AM}{BN} &= \dfrac{\tan\ang{30}}{\tan\ang{60}} \\
		\Rightarrow AM &= BN\cdot\dfrac{\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}}{\sqrt{3}} = \dfrac{BN}{3} \\
		               &= \dfrac{50}{3} = 16\frac{2}{3}\text{ meters}
	\end{align}
\end{solution}
