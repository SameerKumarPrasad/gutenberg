% This is an empty shell file placed for you by the 'examiner' script.

% Now, down to brasstacks. ** Writing good solutions is an Art **. 
% Eventually, you will find your own style. But here are some thoughts 
% to get you started: 
%
%   1. Write to be understood - but be crisp. Your own solution should not take 
%      more space than you will give to the student. Hence, if you take more than 
%      a half-page to write a solution, then give the student a full-page and so on...
%
%   2. Use margin-notes to "talk" to students about the critical insights
%      in the question. The tone can be - in fact, should be - informal
%
%   3. Don't shy away from creating margin-figures you think will help
%      students understand. Yes, it is a little more work per question. 
%      But the question & solution will be written only once. Make that
%      attempt at writing a solution count.
%      
%      3b. Use bc_to_fig.tex. Its an easier way to generate plots & graphs 
% 
%   4. Ensure that there are *no spelling mistakes anywhere*. We are an 
%      education company. Bad spellings suggest that we ourselves 
%      don't have any education. Also, use American spellings by default
% 
%   5. If a question has multiple parts, then first delete lines 40-41
%   6. If a question does not have parts, then first delete lines 43-69
%   
%   7. Create versions of the question when possible. Use commands defined in 
%      tufte-tweaks.sty to do so. Its easier than you think

\begin{solution}	
This is a problem of circular permutation, we first seat the boys at 5 alternate places on a circular table. \\
The number of ways to seat n people around a circular table is (n-1)!\\ 
$\therefore$ the first set of people are seated around the table in $(\vbone -1)! = \k!$ way.\\
Now the rest of the $\vbone$ girls can be seated in the gaps between the $\vbone$ boys in $\vbone!$ ways. \\
Here, since the boys are already seated the $\vbone$.The alternate places are now distinct and do not adhere to the concept of circular permutation.\\
Hence, the total number of arrangements are $\vbone! \cdot \k!$
