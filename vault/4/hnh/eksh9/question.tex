% This is an empty shell file placed for you by the 'examiner' script.
% You can now fill in the TeX for your question here.

% Now, down to brasstacks. ** Writing good solutions is an Art **. 
% Eventually, you will find your own style. But here are some thoughts 
% to get you started: 
%
%   1. Write to be understood - but be crisp. Your own solution should not take 
%      more space than you will give to the student. Hence, if you take more than 
%      a half-page to write a solution, then give the student a full-page and so on...
%
%   2. Use margin-notes to "talk" to students about the critical insights
%      in the question. The tone can be - in fact, should be - informal
%
%   3. Don't shy away from creating margin-figures you think will help
%      students understand. Yes, it is a little more work per question. 
%      But the question & solution will be written only once. Make that
%      attempt at writing a solution count.
%      
%      3b. Use bc_to_fig.tex. Its an easier way to generate plots & graphs 
% 
%   4. Ensure that there are *no spelling mistakes anywhere*. We are an 
%      education company. Bad spellings suggest that we ourselves 
%      don't have any education. Also, use American spellings by default
% 
%   5. If a question has multiple parts, then first delete lines 40-41
%   6. If a question does not have parts, then first delete lines 43-69
%   
%   7. Create versions of the question when possible. Use commands defined in 
%      tufte-tweaks.sty to do so. Its easier than you think

\begin{parts}
  \part How many numbers can be formed without any restrictions.

  \insertQR{}
  \begin{solution}
  Every place can be filled by any these three numbers. Thus $3^\vbone = \k$ numbers can be formed.
  \end{solution}

  \part How many numbers can be formed when the digit 2 occurs only twice.

  \insertQR{}
  \begin{solution}
   Since the digit 2 should occur only twice, we can select any two places form the $\vbone$ digit number and put 2 there. \\
   In $\encr\vbone{2}$ ways. Rest of the places can be filled by any of the digits $1$ or $3$ in $2^{\k}$ ways. \\
   $\therefore$ in all we have $\encr\vbone{2} \times 2^{\k}$ ways.   
  \end{solution}
