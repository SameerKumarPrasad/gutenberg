\begin{solution}
Lets count the number of words that end with \textit{I}.\\
For this, \textit{I} is fixed at the end. Other 8 letters can be rearranged in $\frac{8!}{2!}$ ways.\\
Now we find the words that start with \textit{M} and end with \textit{I}. So, \textit{M} and \textit{I} are fixed at the start and the end and other 7 letters are rearranged in $\frac{7!}{2!}$ ways.\\ \\
Thus, the number of words that do not start with \textit{M} and end with \textit{I} can be found by subtracting this from the total words that have \textit{I} at the end. \\ \\                                                                                            
$\therefore$ the number of words that do not start with \textit{M} and end with \textit{I} $=\frac{8!}{2!} - \frac{7!}{2!}  =  \frac{7\cdot7!}{2}$
\end{solution}
