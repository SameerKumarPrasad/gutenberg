% This is an empty shell file placed for you by the 'examiner' script.
% You can now fill in the TeX for your question here.

% Now, down to brasstacks. ** Writing good solutions is an Art **. 
% Eventually, you will find your own style. But here are some thoughts 
% to get you started: 
%
%   1. Write to be understood - but be crisp. Your own solution should not take 
%      more space than you will give to the student. Hence, if you take more than 
%      a half-page to write a solution, then give the student a full-page and so on...
%
%   2. Use margin-notes to "talk" to students about the critical insights
%      in the question. The tone can be - in fact, should be - informal
%
%   3. Don't shy away from creating margin-figures you think will help
%      students understand. Yes, it is a little more work per question. 
%      But the question & solution will be written only once. Make that
%      attempt at writing a solution count.
%      
%      3b. Use bc_to_fig.tex. Its an easier way to generate plots & graphs 
% 
%   4. Ensure that there are *no spelling mistakes anywhere*. We are an 
%      education company. Bad spellings suggest that we ourselves 
%      don't have any education. Also, use American spellings by default
% 
%   5. If a question has multiple parts, then first delete lines 40-41
%   6. If a question does not have parts, then first delete lines 43-69
%   
%   7. Create versions of the question when possible. Use commands defined in 
%      tufte-tweaks.sty to do so. Its easier than you think

\begin{solution}[\fullpage]
Say a, is the first term and d is the common difference.\\
Hence, the terms of the AP are:\\
\begin{align}
{a}_{3} = a + 2d ;\quad {a}_{8} &= a + 7d \\
{a}_{7} = a + 6d ;\quad {a}_{14} &= a + 14d\\
\text{Now}, {a}_{3} + {a}_{8} &= \vbone\\
\quad {a}_{7} + {a}_{14} &= \vbtwo
\end{align}
Subtracting, we get\\
\begin{align}
(2{a} + 19d) - (2{a} +  9d) = \k \\
\Rightarrow d &= \l \\
\end{align}
Using this value of d in the above equation, value of a is calculated.   
\begin{align}
a = \lbrace (\vbone - 9\times d)/ 2 \rbrace = \m 
\end{align}
Thus, the tenth term : ${a}_{10} = a + 9d = \o $\\
\end{solution}
