% This is an empty shell file placed for you by the 'examiner' script.
% You can now fill in the TeX for your question here.

% Now, down to brasstacks. ** Writing good solutions is an Art **. 
% Eventually, you will find your own style. But here are some thoughts 
% to get you started: 
%
%   1. Write to be understood - but be crisp. Your own solution should not take 
%      more space than you will give to the student. Hence, if you take more than 
%      a half-page to write a solution, then give the student a full-page and so on...
%
%   2. Use margin-notes to "talk" to students about the critical insights
%      in the question. The tone can be - in fact, should be - informal
%
%   3. Don't shy away from creating margin-figures you think will help
%      students understand. Yes, it is a little more work per question. 
%      But the question & solution will be written only once. Make that
%      attempt at writing a solution count.
%      
%      3b. Use bc_to_fig.tex. Its an easier way to generate plots & graphs 
% 
%   4. Ensure that there are *no spelling mistakes anywhere*. We are an 
%      education company. Bad spellings suggest that we ourselves 
%      don't have any education. Also, use American spellings by default
% 
%   5. If a question has multiple parts, then first delete lines 40-41
%   6. If a question does not have parts, then first delete lines 43-69
%   
%   7. Create versions of the question when possible. Use commands defined in 
%      tufte-tweaks.sty to do so. Its easier than you think

\fi 

\begin{solution}
The first digit can not be zero thus we have 9 digits available to choose from. Second digit onwards we can choose from any of the 10 digits.\\
Thus,\\
Total ${\vbone}$ digit numbers are : ${\vbthree} = {\vbfour}$\\ \\
Among these we find the numbers in which no digit is $\vbtwo$\\ \\
Now, the first digit can not be a $0$ or a $\vbtwo$, hence we are left with only 8 remaining digits to choose from. \\
The other numbers can be picked from 9 digits($0 - 9$, except ${\vbtwo}$).\\
Thus, the $\vbone$ digit numbers with no  $\vbtwo$ are : ${\vbfive}$ = ${\vbsix}$\\
\\
Now, we subtract this from total $\vbone$ digit numbers to find the numbers with atleast one digit as ${\vbtwo}$
\begin{align}
\Rightarrow \vbfour - \vbsix = \vbseven
\end{align}
\end{solution}
