% Now, down to brasstacks. ** Writing good solutions is an Art **. 
% Eventually, you will find your own style. But here are some thoughts 
% to get you started: 
%
%   1. Write to be understood - but be crisp. Your own solution should not take 
%      more space than you will give to the student. Hence, if you take more than 
%      a half-page to write a solution, then give the student a full-page and so on...
%
%   2. Use margin-notes to "talk" to students about the critical insights
%      in the question. The tone can be - in fact, should be - informal
%
%   3. Don't shy away from creating margin-figures you think will help
%      students understand. Yes, it is a little more work per question. 
%      But the question & solution will be written only once. Make that
%      attempt at writing a solution count.
%      
%      3b. Use bc_to_fig.tex. Its an easier way to generate plots & graphs 
% 
%   4. Ensure that there are *no spelling mistakes anywhere*. We are an 
%      education company. Bad spellings suggest that we ourselves 
%      don't have any education. Also, use American spellings by default
% 
%   5. If a question has multiple parts, then first delete lines 40-41
%   6. If a question does not have parts, then first delete lines 43-69
%   
%   7. Create versions of the question when possible. Use commands defined in 
%      tufte-tweaks.sty to do so. Its easier than you think

\begin{solution}[\halfpage]
Since all the books of the same  subject are to be kept together. We can assume that the math books are kept in one tray, all physics books in the second tray and all chemistry books in the third tray.\\
\\ 
Now, $\vbone$ math books can be arranged in the first tray in $\vbone!$ ways. $\vbtwo$ math books can be arranged in the second tray in $\vbtwo!$ ways and $\vbthree$ math books can be arranged in the third tray in $\vbthree!$ ways.\\
\\
And the three trays can be rearranged among themselves in $3!$ ways. Thus,\\
total number of arrangements $= 3! \times \vbone! \times \vbtwo! \times \vbthree! $
