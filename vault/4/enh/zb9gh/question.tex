% Now, down to brasstacks. ** Writing good solutions is an Art **. 
% Eventually, you will find your own style. But here are some thoughts 
% to get you started: 
%
%   1. Write to be understood - but be crisp. Your own solution should not take 
%      more space than you will give to the student. Hence, if you take more than 
%      a half-page to write a solution, then give the student a full-page and so on...
%
%   2. Use margin-notes to "talk" to students about the critical insights
%      in the question. The tone can be - in fact, should be - informal
%
%   3. Don't shy away from creating margin-figures you think will help
%      students understand. Yes, it is a little more work per question. 
%      But the question & solution will be written only once. Make that
%      attempt at writing a solution count.
%      
%      3b. Use bc_to_fig.tex. Its an easier way to generate plots & graphs 
% 
%   4. Ensure that there are *no spelling mistakes anywhere*. We are an 
%      education company. Bad spellings suggest that we ourselves 
%      don't have any education. Also, use American spellings by default
% 
%   5. If a question has multiple parts, then first delete lines 40-41
%   6. If a question does not have parts, then first delete lines 43-69
%   
%   7. Create versions of the question when possible. Use commands defined in 
%      tufte-tweaks.sty to do so. Its easier than you think

\fi 

\begin{solution}[\mcq]
A 7-digit number will be formed using these digits, we have four available odd places and four odd numbers $\lbrace\vbtwo\rbrace$.\\
\\
These can be arranged at four places in $\dfrac{4!}{2!\cdot2!}$ $\left[\text{ As two numbers repeat themselves} \right]$\\
Now, the remaining 3 digits can be rearranged at 3 places in $\dfrac{3!}{2!}$ $\left[ \text{As $\vbthree$ repeats itself} \right]$\\
Thus,\\
total arrangements$ =\dfrac{4!}{2!\cdot2!} \times \dfrac{3!}{2!} = 18$
