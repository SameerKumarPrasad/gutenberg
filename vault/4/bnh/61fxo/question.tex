% This is an empty shell file placed for you by the 'examiner' script.
% You can now fill in the TeX for your question here.

% Now, down to brasstacks. ** Writing good solutions is an Art **. 
% Eventually, you will find your own style. But here are some thoughts 
% to get you started: 
%
%   1. Write to be understood - but be crisp. Your own solution should not take 
%      more space than you will give to the student. Hence, if you take more than 
%      a half-page to write a solution, then give the student a full-page and so on...
%
%   2. Use margin-notes to "talk" to students about the critical insights
%      in the question. The tone can be - in fact, should be - informal
%
%   3. Don't shy away from creating margin-figures you think will help
%      students understand. Yes, it is a little more work per question. 
%      But the question & solution will be written only once. Make that
%      attempt at writing a solution count.
%      
%      3b. Use bc_to_fig.tex. Its an easier way to generate plots & graphs 
% 
%   4. Ensure that there are *no spelling mistakes anywhere*. We are an 
%      education company. Bad spellings suggest that we ourselves 
%      don't have any education. Also, use American spellings by default
% 
%   5. If a question has multiple parts, then first delete lines 40-41
%   6. If a question does not have parts, then first delete lines 43-69
%   
%   7. Create versions of the question when possible. Use commands defined in 
%      tufte-tweaks.sty to do so. Its easier than you think

\begin{parts}
  \part Repetition of digit is allowed

  \insertQR{}
  \begin{solution}
  The units place can be filled by any of these 5 digits in 5 ways. \\
  Since, the repetition of digits is allowed the tens place can again be filled by any of these 5 digits and so is the case with the hundredth place. \\
  Thus by using multiplication method the total number of ways are $5\times 5 \times 5 = 125$\\  
  \end{solution}

  \part Repetition is not allowed

  \insertQR{}
  \begin{solution}
  The units place is filled first, by anyone of the 5 digits in 5 ways.\\
  Since repetition is not allowed, the number that is at the units place can not be used at other places.\\
  Hence, the tens place can be filled by the remaining 4 digits only. Similarly, the hundredth place can be filled by remaining 3 digits only in 3 ways.\\
  By multiplication method the total number of ways are\\ $5\times 4 \times 3 = 60$\\
   \end{solution}
