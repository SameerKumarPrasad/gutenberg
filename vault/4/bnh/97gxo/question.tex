% Now, down to brasstacks. ** Writing good solutions is an Art **. 
% Eventually, you will find your own style. But here are some thoughts 
% to get you started: 
%
%   1. Write to be understood - but be crisp. Your own solution should not take 
%      more space than you will give to the student. Hence, if you take more than 
%      a half-page to write a solution, then give the student a full-page and so on...
%
%   2. Use margin-notes to "talk" to students about the critical insights
%      in the question. The tone can be - in fact, should be - informal
%
%   3. Don't shy away from creating margin-figures you think will help
%      students understand. Yes, it is a little more work per question. 
%      But the question & solution will be written only once. Make that
%      attempt at writing a solution count.
%      
%      3b. Use bc_to_fig.tex. Its an easier way to generate plots & graphs 
% 
%   4. Ensure that there are *no spelling mistakes anywhere*. We are an 
%      education company. Bad spellings suggest that we ourselves 
%      don't have any education. Also, use American spellings by default
% 
%   5. If a question has multiple parts, then first delete lines 40-41
%   6. If a question does not have parts, then first delete lines 43-69
%   
%   7. Create versions of the question when possible. Use commands defined in 
%      tufte-tweaks.sty to do so. Its easier than you think

\begin{solution}
In questions like these, where the series of a binomial coefficient is present. We first write the expansion of $(1+x)^n$  \\
\begin{align}
(1+x)^n = \encr{n}{0} + \encr{n}{1} \cdot x  + \encr{n}{2} \cdot x^2 + \cdots + \encr{n}{n} \cdot x^n  
\end{align} 
Observe, that in the original series the coefficients are alternately positive and negative. To achieve that we put -x in place of x,\\
the expansion now becomes
\begin{align}
(1-x)^n = \encr{n}{0} - \encr{n}{1}\cdot x + \encr{n}{2}\cdot x^2 - \cdots + \left((-1)^{n}\right) \encr{n}{n}\cdot  x^{n}
\end{align}  
Notice the last term in the series it has a power of $2n+1$ whereas in our expansion of $(1-x)^{n}$ it is $n$. Therefore, we put $x^2$ in place of $x$ in the above expansion and multiply the complete series by $x$.
\begin{align}
x(1-x^2)^n =   \encr{n}{0}\cdot x - \encr{n}{1}\cdot x^3  + \encr{n}{2} \cdot x^{5} - \cdots + \left((-1)^{n}\right) \encr{n}{n} \cdot x^{2n+1} 
\end{align}  
Differentiating both sides with respect to x.
\begin{align}
&\Rightarrow (1-x^2)^n-2nx^2(1-x^2)^{n-1} \nonumber \\
&= \encr{n}{0} - 3\cdot \encr{n}{1}\cdot  x^2  + 5\cdot \encr{n}{2}\cdot x^4  - \cdots +  \left((-1)^{n} (2n+1)\right) \encr{n}{n} \cdot  x^{2n} 
\end{align}  
Put $x =1$ in the above series so that it becomes the same as the series in the question.
\begin{align}
\therefore 0 = \encr{n}{0} - 3\cdot \encr{n}{1} + 5\cdot \encr{n}{2} - \cdots + (-1)^{n} (2n+1) \cdot \encr{n}{n} 
\end{align} 
Thus, the sum of the series asked in the question is zero.
\end{solution}
