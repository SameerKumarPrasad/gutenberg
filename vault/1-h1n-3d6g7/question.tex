% This is an empty shell file placed for you by the 'examiner' script.
% You can now fill in the TeX for your question here.

% Now, down to brasstacks. ** Writing good solutions is an Art **. 
% Eventually, you will find your own style. But here are some thoughts 
% to get you started: 
%
%   1. Write the solution as if you are writing it for your favorite
%      14-17 year old to help him/her understand. Could be your nephew, 
%      your niece, a cousin perhaps or probably even you when you 
%      were that age. Just write for them.
%
%   2. Use margin-notes to "talk" to students about the critical insights
%      in the question. The tone can be - in fact, should be - informal
%
%   3. Don't shy away from creating margin-figures you think will help
%      students understand. Yes, it is a little more work per question. 
%      But the question & solution will be written only once. Make that
%      attempt at writing a solution count.
%
%   4. At the same time, do not be too verbose. A long solution can
%      - at first sight - make the student think, "God, that is a lot to know".
%      Our aim is not to scare students. Rather, our aim should be to 
%      create many "Aha!" moments everyday in classrooms around the world
% 
%   5. Ensure that there are *no spelling mistakes anywhere*. We are an 
%      education company. Bad spellings suggest that we ourselves 
%      don't have any education. Also, use American spellings by default
% 
%   6. If a question has multiple parts, then first delete lines 40-41
%   7. If a question does not have parts, then first delete lines 43-69

\question[3] A torpedo boat is anchored $9$ km away from the \textit{nearest} point
on the shore. A messenger must be sent from the torpedo boat to a camp that is 
$15km$ away - along the shore - from that nearest point on the shore. If a messenger
can walk at $5$ km per hour and row at $4$ km per hour, then where on the shore must
he land in order to reach the camp in the shortest possible time?

\begin{solution}[\fullpage]
   If $T$ be the total time it takes row to the landing point - \asif - 
   and then walk from the landing point to the camp, then
   \begin{align}
       T &= \dfrac{\sqrt{(9^2+x^2)}}{4} + \dfrac{15-x}{5} \\
       \Rightarrow \dfrac{\ud T}{\ud x} &= \left( \dfrac{1}{4}\cdot\dfrac{1}{2}\cdot\dfrac{2x}{\sqrt{x^2+81}}\right) - \dfrac{1}{5} \\
       \Rightarrow \dfrac{\ud T}{\ud x} &= 0\text{ when } \dfrac{x}{\sqrt{x^2+81}} = \dfrac{4}{5}
       \text{ or } x = 12 \\
       \text{Also, }\dfrac{\ud^2 T}{\ud x^2} &= \dfrac{1}{4\cdot(x^2+81)^{\frac{1}{2}}} 
                         - \dfrac{x}{4}\times\dfrac{1}{2}\times\dfrac{1}{(x^2+81)^{\frac{3}{2}}} \\
                         &= \dfrac{1}{4\cdot(x^2+81)^{\frac{3}{2}}}\times(x^2-x+81) \\
                         &> 0 \text{ for } x = 12 \Rightarrow \text{ minima }
   \end{align}
   
   Hence, the messenger should land $3(= 15 -12)$ km from the camp
\end{solution}
