% This is an empty shell file placed for you by the 'examiner' script.

% Now, down to brasstacks. ** Writing good solutions is an Art **. 
% Eventually, you will find your own style. But here are some thoughts 
% to get you started: 
%
%   1. Write the solution as if you are writing it for your favorite
%      14-17 year old to help him/her understand. Could be your nephew, 
%      your niece, a cousin perhaps or probably even you when you 
%      were that age. Just write for them.
%
%   2. Use margin-notes to "talk" to students about the critical insights
%      in the question. The tone can be - in fact, should be - informal
%
%   3. Don't shy away from creating margin-figures you think will help
%      students understand. Yes, it is a little more work per question. 
%      But the question & solution will be written only once. Make that
%      attempt at writing a solution count.
%
%   4. At the same time, do not be too verbose. A long solution can
%      - at first sight - make the student think, "God, that is a lot to know".
%      Our aim is not to scare students. Rather, our aim should be to 
%      create many "Aha!" moments everyday in classrooms around the world
% 
%   5. Ensure that there are *no spelling mistakes anywhere*. We are an 
%      education company. Bad spellings suggest that we ourselves 
%      don't have any education. Also, use American spellings by default
% 
%   6. If a question has multiple parts, then first delete lines 40-41
%   7. If a question does not have parts, then first delete lines 43-69

\question[3] If $\text{cosec }\theta - \sin\theta = a$ and $\sec\theta - \cos\theta = b$, then 
find the value of $a^{\frac{2}{3}}\cdot b^{\frac{2}{3}}\cdot(a^{\frac{2}{3}}+b^{\frac{2}{3}})$

\begin{solution}[\halfpage]
	\begin{align}
		\text{cosec }\theta - \sin\theta &= \dfrac{1}{\sin\theta} - \sin\theta = a \\
		\Rightarrow \dfrac{\cos^2\theta}{\sin\theta} &= a \\
		\text{Similarly, }\sec\theta - \cos\theta &= \dfrac{1}{\cos\theta} - \cos\theta = b \\
		\Rightarrow \dfrac{\sin^2\theta}{\cos\theta} &= b \\
		\therefore (a\cdot b)^{\frac{2}{3}}\cdot(a^{\frac{2}{3}} + b^{\frac{2}{3}}) &= 
		\cos^{\frac{2}{3}}\theta\cdot\sin^{\frac{2}{3}}\theta\times
		\left[ \dfrac{\cos^{\frac{4}{3}}\theta}{\sin^{\frac{2}{3}}\theta} + 
		\dfrac{\sin^{\frac{4}{3}}\theta}{\cos^{\frac{2}{3}}\theta}\right] \\
		&= \cos^2\theta + \sin^2\theta = 1
	\end{align}
