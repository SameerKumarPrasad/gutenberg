% Now, down to brasstacks. ** Writing good solutions is an Art **. 
% Eventually, you will find your own style. But here are some thoughts 
% to get you started: 
%
%   1. Write the solution as if you are writing it for your favorite
%      14-17 year old to help him/her understand. Could be your nephew, 
%      your niece, a cousin perhaps or probably even you when you 
%      were that age. Just write for them.
%
%   2. Use margin-notes to "talk" to students about the critical insights
%      in the question. The tone can be - in fact, should be - informal
%
%   3. Don't shy away from creating margin-figures you think will help
%      students understand. Yes, it is a little more work per question. 
%      But the question & solution will be written only once. Make that
%      attempt at writing a solution count.
%
%   4. At the same time, do not be too verbose. A long solution can
%      - at first sight - make the student think, "God, that is a lot to know".
%      Our aim is not to scare students. Rather, our aim should be to 
%      create many "Aha!" moments everyday in classrooms around the world
% 
%   5. Ensure that there are *no spelling mistakes anywhere*. We are an 
%      education company. Bad spellings suggest that we ourselves 
%      don't have any education. Also, use American spellings by default
% 
%   6. If a question has multiple parts, then first delete lines 40-41
%   7. If a question does not have parts, then first delete lines 43-69

\question Find an expression for the sum of the first $n$ terms of 
$\dfrac{1}{1\cdot 4} + \dfrac{1}{4\cdot 7} + \ldots + \dfrac{1}{(3n-2)\cdot(3n+1) + \ldots}$

\begin{solution}
	\begin{align}
		S_n &= \sum_{k=1}^{n}\dfrac{1}{(3n-2)\cdot(3n+1)} = 
		\sum_{k=1}^{n}\dfrac{1}{3}\cdot\dfrac{(3n+1) - (3n-2)}{(3n-2)\cdot(3n+1)} \\
		&= \dfrac{1}{3}\left[ \sum_{k=1}^{n}\dfrac{1}{3n-2} - \sum_{k=1}^{n}\dfrac{1}{3n+1}\right]
	\end{align}
	Now, $3n-2 = 3k + 1$ if $n = k + 1$. Which means, that every term \textit{after} the first
	term in the first summand can be found in the second summand - and, more importantly - will 
	cancel itself out. In other words,
	
	\begin{align}
		S_n &= \dfrac{1}{3}\cdot\left[\left( 1+\frac{1}{4}+\ldots +\frac{1}{3n-2}\right)
		- \left( \frac{1}{4} + \ldots + \frac{1}{3n-2} + \frac{1}{3n+1}\right) \right] \\
		&= \dfrac{1}{3}\cdot\left( 1-\dfrac{1}{3n+1}\right) = \dfrac{n}{3n+1}
	\end{align}
\end{solution}
