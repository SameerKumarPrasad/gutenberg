% This is an empty shell file placed for you by the 'examiner' script.
% You can now fill in the TeX for your question here.

% Now, down to brasstacks. ** Writing good solutions is an Art **. 
% Eventually, you will find your own style. But here are some thoughts 
% to get you started: 
%
%   1. Write the solution as if you are writing it for your favorite
%      14-17 year old to help him/her understand. Could be your nephew, 
%      your niece, a cousin perhaps or probably even you when you 
%      were that age. Just write for them.
%
%   2. Use margin-notes to "talk" to students about the critical insights
%      in the question. The tone can be - in fact, should be - informal
%
%   3. Don't shy away from creating margin-figures you think will help
%      students understand. Yes, it is a little more work per question. 
%      But the question & solution will be written only once. Make that
%      attempt at writing a solution count.
%
%   4. At the same time, do not be too verbose. A long solution can
%      - at first sight - make the student think, "God, that is a lot to know".
%      Our aim is not to scare students. Rather, our aim should be to 
%      create many "Aha!" moments everyday in classrooms around the world
% 
%   5. Ensure that there are *no spelling mistakes anywhere*. We are an 
%      education company. Bad spellings suggest that we ourselves 
%      don't have any education. Also, use American spellings by default
% 
%   6. If a question has multiple parts, then first delete lines 40-41
%   7. If a question does not have parts, then first delete lines 43-69

\question A \SI{160}{\centi\metre} tall man walks away from a source of light 
mounted on a \SI{6}{\meter} high pole at the rate of \SI{1.1}{\meter\per\second}.
How fast is the length of his shadow increasing when he is \SI{1}{\meter} away from the pole?

\marginnote[0.3cm]{Actually, it makes no difference how far the man is from the
light source. His shadow will increase in length at the same rate !}
\fi 

\begin{solution}
  In the figure alongside, $L$ is the length of the shadow and $x$
  the distance the man is away from the pole
  
  \begin{align}
    \tan\theta &= \dfrac{1.6\si{\meter}}{L} = \dfrac{6\si{\meter}}{L+x} \\
    \Rightarrow L &= \dfrac{1.6}{4.4}x \\
    \Rightarrow \dfrac{\ud L}{\ud t} &= \dfrac{1.6}{4.4}\times\dfrac{\ud x}{\ud t} \\
       &= \dfrac{1.6}{4.4}\times\SI{1.1}{\meter\per\second} \\
       &= \SI{0.4}{\meter\per\second}
  \end{align}
\end{solution}
