% This is an empty shell file placed for you by the 'examiner' script.
% You can now fill in the TeX for your question here.

% Now, down to brasstacks. ** Writing good solutions is an Art **. 
% Eventually, you will find your own style. But here are some thoughts 
% to get you started: 
%
%   1. Write the solution as if you are writing it for your favorite
%      14-17 year old to help him/her understand. Could be your nephew, 
%      your niece, a cousin perhaps or probably even you when you 
%      were that age. Just write for them.
%
%   2. Use margin-notes to "talk" to students about the critical insights
%      in the question. The tone can be - in fact, should be - informal
%
%   3. Don't shy away from creating margin-figures you think will help
%      students understand. Yes, it is a little more work per question. 
%      But the question & solution will be written only once. Make that
%      attempt at writing a solution count.
%
%   4. At the same time, do not be too verbose. A long solution can
%      - at first sight - make the student think, "God, that is a lot to know".
%      Our aim is not to scare students. Rather, our aim should be to 
%      create many "Aha!" moments everyday in classrooms around the world
% 
%   5. Ensure that there are *no spelling mistakes anywhere*. We are an 
%      education company. Bad spellings suggest that we ourselves 
%      don't have any education. And, use American spellings

\question[3] What is my name?

\ifprintanswers
  % stuff to be shown only in the answer key - like explanatory margin figures
\fi 

\begin{solution}
	My name is Abhinav
\end{solution}
\begin{parts}
	\part[2] Who gave you your name?
	\begin{solution}
	    My parents did, who else?
	    \begin{align}
	    	\Rightarrow \int_0^2 x^2\ud x &= \dfrac{4}{3}
	    \end{align}
	\end{solution}
	\part[3] What is $\exp^{\iota\pi}$ equal to?
	\begin{solution}
		\begin{align}
			e^{\iota\pi} + 1 &= 0 \\
			\Rightarrow e^{\iota\pi} &= -1
		\end{align}
	\end{solution}
\end{parts}
