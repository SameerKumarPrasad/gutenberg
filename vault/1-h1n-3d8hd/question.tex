% This is an empty shell file placed for you by the 'examiner' script.
% You can now fill in the TeX for your question here.

% Now, down to brasstacks. ** Writing good solutions is an Art **. 
% Eventually, you will find your own style. But here are some thoughts 
% to get you started: 
%
%   1. Write the solution as if you are writing it for your favorite
%      14-17 year old to help him/her understand. Could be your nephew, 
%      your niece, a cousin perhaps or probably even you when you 
%      were that age. Just write for them.
%
%   2. Use margin-notes to "talk" to students about the critical insights
%      in the question. The tone can be - in fact, should be - informal
%
%   3. Don't shy away from creating margin-figures you think will help
%      students understand. Yes, it is a little more work per question. 
%      But the question & solution will be written only once. Make that
%      attempt at writing a solution count.
%
%   4. At the same time, do not be too verbose. A long solution can
%      - at first sight - make the student think, "God, that is a lot to know".
%      Our aim is not to scare students. Rather, our aim should be to 
%      create many "Aha!" moments everyday in classrooms around the world
% 
%   5. Ensure that there are *no spelling mistakes anywhere*. We are an 
%      education company. Bad spellings suggest that we ourselves 
%      don't have any education. Also, use American spellings by default
% 
%   6. If a question has multiple parts, then first delete lines 40-41
%   7. If a question does not have parts, then first delete lines 43-69

\begin{solution}
	The parabolas intersect at points where, 
	\begin{align}
		y = x^2 &= (x^2)^2 = x^4 \\
		\Rightarrow x^4-x &= 0 \text{ or } x\cdot(x^3-1) = 0 \\
		\Rightarrow x &= 0,1 \\
		\Rightarrow y &= 0^2, 1^2 \text{ or } (x,y) = (0,0) \text{ and } (1,1)
	\end{align}
	
	The angles at which the parabolas intersect are the angles at which 
	the \textit{tangents} of each at the intersection points intersect
	
	Hence, at $(x,y) = (0,0)$
	\begin{align}
		\left[\dydx\right]_{x=0} = (2x)_{x=0} = 0 &\Rightarrow \psi_1 = \tan^{-1}0 = \ang{0} \\
		\left[\dydx\right]_{x=0} = (\dfrac{1}{2\sqrt{x}})_{x=0} = \infty &\Rightarrow \psi_2 
		= \tan^{-1}\infty = \ang{90} \\
		\therefore\text{ Angle of intersection at origin } &= \psi_2-\psi_1 = \ang{90}
	\end{align}
	
	Similarly, at $(x,y) = (1,1)$
	\begin{align}
		\left[\dydx\right]_{x=1} = (2x)_{x=1} = 2 &\Rightarrow \psi_1 = \tan^{-1}2 = \ang{63.44} \\
		\left[\dydx\right]_{x=1} = (\dfrac{1}{2\sqrt{x}})_{x=1} = \frac{1}{2} &\Rightarrow \psi_2 
		= \tan^{-1}\frac{1}{2} = \ang{26.57} \\
		\therefore\text{ Angle of intersection at }(1,1) &= \psi_1-\psi_2 = \ang{36.87}
	\end{align}
\end{solution}
