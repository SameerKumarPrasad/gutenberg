% Now, down to brasstacks. ** Writing good solutions is an Art **. 
% Eventually, you will find your own style. But here are some thoughts 
% to get you started: 
%
%   1. Write the solution as if you are writing it for your favorite
%      14-17 year old to help him/her understand. Could be your nephew, 
%      your niece, a cousin perhaps or probably even you when you 
%      were that age. Just write for them.
%
%   2. Use margin-notes to "talk" to students about the critical insights
%      in the question. The tone can be - in fact, should be - informal
%
%   3. Don't shy away from creating margin-figures you think will help
%      students understand. Yes, it is a little more work per question. 
%      But the question & solution will be written only once. Make that
%      attempt at writing a solution count.
%
%   4. At the same time, do not be too verbose. A long solution can
%      - at first sight - make the student think, "God, that is a lot to know".
%      Our aim is not to scare students. Rather, our aim should be to 
%      create many "Aha!" moments everyday in classrooms around the world
% 
%   5. Ensure that there are *no spelling mistakes anywhere*. We are an 
%      education company. Bad spellings suggest that we ourselves 
%      don't have any education. Also, use American spellings by default
% 
%   6. If a question has multiple parts, then first delete lines 40-41
%   7. If a question does not have parts, then first delete lines 43-69

\begin{solution}
	\begin{align}
		S_n &= \sum_{k=1}^{n}\underbrace{\eSumOfSquares{n}}_{\text{sum of squares}} \\
		&= \dfrac{1}{6}\cdot\sum_{k=1}^{n}(2n^3+3n^2+n) \\
		&= \dfrac{1}{6}\cdot\left[ 2\cdot\eSumOfCubes{n} + 3\cdot\eSumOfSquares{n} + \eSumOfN{n}\right] \\
		&= \dfrac{n\cdot(n+1)}{12}\cdot\lbrace\underbrace{n\cdot(n+1) + 2n + 1 + 1}_{=(n+1)\cdot(n+2)}\rbrace \\
		&= \dfrac{n\cdot(n+1)^2\cdot(n+2)}{12}
	\end{align}
