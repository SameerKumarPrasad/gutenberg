% Now, down to brasstacks. ** Writing good solutions is an Art **. 
% Eventually, you will find your own style. But here are some thoughts 
% to get you started: 
%
%   1. Write to be understood - but be crisp. Your own solution should not take 
%      more space than you will give to the student. Hence, if you take more than 
%      a half-page to write a solution, then give the student a full-page and so on...
%
%   2. Use margin-notes to "talk" to students about the critical insights
%      in the question. The tone can be - in fact, should be - informal
%
%   3. Don't shy away from creating margin-figures you think will help
%      students understand. Yes, it is a little more work per question. 
%      But the question & solution will be written only once. Make that
%      attempt at writing a solution count.
%      
%      3b. Use bc_to_fig.tex. Its an easier way to generate plots & graphs 
% 
%   4. Ensure that there are *no spelling mistakes anywhere*. We are an 
%      education company. Bad spellings suggest that we ourselves 
%      don't have any education. Also, use American spellings by default
% 
%   5. If a question has multiple parts, then first delete lines 40-41
%   6. If a question does not have parts, then first delete lines 43-69
%   
%   7. Create versions of the question when possible. Use commands defined in 
%      tufte-tweaks.sty to do so. Its easier than you think

\question[4] If a line that passes through a point $A = (\vbone, \vbtwo)$ has slope equal to $\dfrac\vbthree\vbfour$, then 
find the points on it that are $\vbfive$ units away from $A$

\begin{solution}[\halfpage]
	The equation of the given line would be 
	\begin{align}
		\dfrac{y-\vbtwo}{x-\vbone} &= \vbsix \Rightarrow y = \dfrac\vbthree\vbfour\cdot x + \WRITEFRAC\n\m
	\end{align}
	Moreover, any point that is $\vbfive$ units away from $A$ would satisy 
	the following condition 
	\begin{align}
		(x - \vbone)^2 + (y-\vbtwo)^2 &= (\vbfive)^2 
	\end{align}
	And if this point also happens to be on the line, then 
	\begin{align}
		(x-\vbone)^2 + \left[ \left( \vbsix\cdot x + \dfrac\n\m\right) - \vbtwo \right]^2 &= \vbfive^2 \\
		\Rightarrow (x - \vbone)^2\cdot\left[ 1 + \left( \vbsix \right)^2\right] &= \vbfive^2 \\
    \Rightarrow (x - \vbone)^2 &= \f  \\ 
    \Rightarrow x &=  \h,\,\j
	\end{align}
	
    
  Plug these values of $x$ into the equation for the line - $(1)$ - and you will 
  get the required coordinates -  $(\h,\WRITEFRAC\aa\ab)$ and $(\j,\WRITEFRAC\ba\bb)$
