% Now, down to brasstacks. ** Writing good solutions is an Art **. 
% Eventually, you will find your own style. But here are some thoughts 
% to get you started: 
%
%   1. Write to be understood - but be crisp. Your own solution should not take 
%      more space than you will give to the student. Hence, if you take more than 
%      a half-page to write a solution, then give the student a full-page and so on...
%
%   2. Use margin-notes to "talk" to students about the critical insights
%      in the question. The tone can be - in fact, should be - informal
%
%   3. Don't shy away from creating margin-figures you think will help
%      students understand. Yes, it is a little more work per question. 
%      But the question & solution will be written only once. Make that
%      attempt at writing a solution count.
%      
%      3b. Use bc_to_fig.tex. Its an easier way to generate plots & graphs 
% 
%   4. Ensure that there are *no spelling mistakes anywhere*. We are an 
%      education company. Bad spellings suggest that we ourselves 
%      don't have any education. Also, use American spellings by default
% 
%   5. If a question has multiple parts, then first delete lines 40-41
%   6. If a question does not have parts, then first delete lines 43-69
%   
%   7. Create versions of the question when possible. Use commands defined in 
%      tufte-tweaks.sty to do so. Its easier than you think

\begin{solution}[\halfpage]
   There is a point - lets say $B$ - on $L_1$ that when joined with $A$ forms a line parallel to $L_2$. 
   We need to find the distance between $A$ and $B$. Simple $\ldots$
  
  Now, the point $B = (m,n)$ satisfies the following two conditions
  \begin{align}
  	\gsign\vbthree m \gsign\vbfour n &= \vbfive \because \text{ its on } L_1 \\
  	\dfrac{\vbtwo - n}{\vbone - m} &= \dfrac{\n}{\d} \because AB \parallel L_2 \\
  	\Rightarrow \n m - \d n &= \c
  \end{align}
  Solving (1) and (3), we get $B = (m,n) = (\p,\q)$. Now we know everything to calculate the distance 
  between $A$ and $B$
  \begin{align}
    D &= \sqrt{(\p - \vbone)^2 + (\q - \vbtwo)^2} = \vbnine
  \end{align}
\end{solution}
