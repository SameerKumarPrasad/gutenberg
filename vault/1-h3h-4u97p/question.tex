% This is an empty shell file placed for you by the 'examiner' script.
% You can now fill in the TeX for your question here.

% Now, down to brasstacks. ** Writing good solutions is an Art **. 
% Eventually, you will find your own style. But here are some thoughts 
% to get you started: 
%
%   1. Write the solution as if you are writing it for your favorite
%      14-17 year old to help him/her understand. Could be your nephew, 
%      your niece, a cousin perhaps or probably even you when you 
%      were that age. Just write for them.
%
%   2. Use margin-notes to "talk" to students about the critical insights
%      in the question. The tone can be - in fact, should be - informal
%
%   3. Don't shy away from creating margin-figures you think will help
%      students understand. Yes, it is a little more work per question. 
%      But the question & solution will be written only once. Make that
%      attempt at writing a solution count.
%
%   4. At the same time, do not be too verbose. A long solution can
%      - at first sight - make the student think, "God, that is a lot to know".
%      Our aim is not to scare students. Rather, our aim should be to 
%      create many "Aha!" moments everyday in classrooms around the world
% 
%   5. Ensure that there are *no spelling mistakes anywhere*. We are an 
%      education company. Bad spellings suggest that we ourselves 
%      don't have any education. Also, use American spellings by default
% 
%   6. If a question has multiple parts, then first delete lines 40-41
%   7. If a question does not have parts, then first delete lines 43-69

\question[2] Find the derivative of $\int_{x^2}^1 \ln z\ud z$ with respect to $x$

\begin{solution}[\halfpage]
	Let,
	\begin{align}
		u(z) &= \ln z \\
		\text{and } v(z) &= z \text{ so that } v'(z) = 1 \\
	\end{align}
	And so,
	\begin{align}
		\int\ln z\ud z &= \int u(z)\cdot v'(z)\ud z \\
		&= \underbrace{u(z)v(z) - \int u'(z)v(z)\ud z}_{\text{integration by parts}} \\
		&= z\ln z - \int\dfrac{1}{z}\cdot z\ud z \\
		&= z\cdot(\ln z - 1) + C \\
		\Rightarrow \int_{x^2}^1\ln z \ud z &= \left[ z\cdot(\ln z - 1)\right]_{x^2}^1 \\
		&= x^2 - 2x^2\ln x
	\end{align}
	Which means that the required derivative is 
	\begin{align}
		\dfrac{\ud}{\ud x}(x^2-2x^2\ln x) &= -4x\ln x
	\end{align}
\end{solution}
