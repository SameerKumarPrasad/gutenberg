% This is an empty shell file placed for you by the 'examiner' script.
% You can now fill in the TeX for your question here.

% Now, down to brasstacks. ** Writing good solutions is an Art **. 
% Eventually, you will find your own style. But here are some thoughts 
% to get you started: 
%
%   1. Write the solution as if you are writing it for your favorite
%      14-17 year old to help him/her understand. Could be your nephew, 
%      your niece, a cousin perhaps or probably even you when you 
%      were that age. Just write for them.
%
%   2. Use margin-notes to "talk" to students about the critical insights
%      in the question. The tone can be - in fact, should be - informal
%
%   3. Don't shy away from creating margin-figures you think will help
%      students understand. Yes, it is a little more work per question. 
%      But the question & solution will be written only once. Make that
%      attempt at writing a solution count.
%
%   4. At the same time, do not be too verbose. A long solution can
%      - at first sight - make the student think, "God, that is a lot to know".
%      Our aim is not to scare students. Rather, our aim should be to 
%      create many "Aha!" moments everyday in classrooms around the world
% 
%   5. Ensure that there are *no spelling mistakes anywhere*. We are an 
%      education company. Bad spellings suggest that we ourselves 
%      don't have any education. Also, use American spellings by default
% 
%   6. If a question has multiple parts, then first delete lines 40-41
%   7. If a question does not have parts, then first delete lines 43-69

\question[3] If $x^{2x}-2x^{x}\cot y - 1 = 0$, then what is $y'(1)$?

\begin{solution}[\halfpage]
	\begin{align}
	  \text{If } x^{2x}-2x^{x}\cot y - 1 &= 0 \\
	  \text{then } \cot y &= \dfrac{1}{2}\left[x^{x}-\dfrac{1}{x^{x}} \right] = 0 \text{ when } x=1 \\
	  \Rightarrow -\csc^2 y\dydx &= \dfrac{1}{2}\left[x\cdot x^{x-1} + \dfrac{x}{x^{x+1}}\right] \\
	  \Rightarrow -(1 + \cot^2 y)\dydx &= \dfrac{1}{2}\left[x\cdot x^{x-1} + \dfrac{x}{x^{x+1}}\right] \\
	\end{align}
	Plugging in $x=1$ in the above equation, we get
	\begin{align}
		-(1+0)\dydx &= \dfrac{1}{2}(1 + 1) = 1 \\
		\Rightarrow \dydx &= -1 \text{ when } x = 1
	\end{align}
\end{solution}
