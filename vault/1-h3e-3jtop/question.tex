% Now, down to brasstacks. ** Writing good solutions is an Art **. 
% Eventually, you will find your own style. But here are some thoughts 
% to get you started: 
%
%   1. Write the solution as if you are writing it for your favorite
%      14-17 year old to help him/her understand. Could be your nephew, 
%      your niece, a cousin perhaps or probably even you when you 
%      were that age. Just write for them.
%
%   2. Use margin-notes to "talk" to students about the critical insights
%      in the question. The tone can be - in fact, should be - informal
%
%   3. Don't shy away from creating margin-figures you think will help
%      students understand. Yes, it is a little more work per question. 
%      But the question & solution will be written only once. Make that
%      attempt at writing a solution count.
%
%   4. At the same time, do not be too verbose. A long solution can
%      - at first sight - make the student think, "God, that is a lot to know".
%      Our aim is not to scare students. Rather, our aim should be to 
%      create many "Aha!" moments everyday in classrooms around the world
% 
%   5. Ensure that there are *no spelling mistakes anywhere*. We are an 
%      education company. Bad spellings suggest that we ourselves 
%      don't have any education. Also, use American spellings by default
% 
%   6. If a question has multiple parts, then first delete lines 40-41
%   7. If a question does not have parts, then first delete lines 43-69

\question A box has 3 drawers; one contains 2 gold coins, one contains two silver coins
and one contains one gold and one silver coin. If a drawer is selected randomly 
and the one coin picked from it turns out to be gold, then what is the probability
that the coin was picked from the drawer with two gold coins?

  \begin{table}
    \begin{tabular}{cccc}
       \toprule
       Drawer & A & B & C \\
       \midrule
       N( gold coins ) & 2 & 0 & 1 \\
       $P(\text{gold coin} \vert \text{drawer})$ & 1 & 0 & 0.5 \\
       \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}
  \end{table}
\fi 

\begin{solution}
    The probability we are seeking is $P(A \vert G)$, where $G$ is the event of drawing
    a gold coin
    
    Now, 
    \begin{align}
       \bayesp{A}{G} &= \dfrac{\bayesf{G}{A}}{\bayesf{G}{A} + \bayesf{G}{B} + \bayesf{G}{C}} \\
          &= \dfrac{1\cdot\frac{1}{3}}{1\cdot\frac{1}{3} + 0\cdot\frac{1}{3} 
          + \frac{1}{2}\cdot\frac{1}{3}} \\
          &= \dfrac{2}{3}
    \end{align}
\end{solution}
