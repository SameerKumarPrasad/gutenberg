% This is an empty shell file placed for you by the 'examiner' script.

% Now, down to brasstacks. ** Writing good solutions is an Art **. 
% Eventually, you will find your own style. But here are some thoughts 
% to get you started: 
%
%   1. Write to be understood - but be crisp. Your own solution should not take 
%      more space than you will give to the student. Hence, if you take more than 
%      a half-page to write a solution, then give the student a full-page and so on...
%
%   2. Use margin-notes to "talk" to students about the critical insights
%      in the question. The tone can be - in fact, should be - informal
%
%   3. Don't shy away from creating margin-figures you think will help
%      students understand. Yes, it is a little more work per question. 
%      But the question & solution will be written only once. Make that
%      attempt at writing a solution count.
%      
%      3b. Use bc_to_fig.tex. Its an easier way to generate plots & graphs 
% 
%   4. Ensure that there are *no spelling mistakes anywhere*. We are an 
%      education company. Bad spellings suggest that we ourselves 
%      don't have any education. Also, use American spellings by default
% 
%   5. If a question has multiple parts, then first delete lines 40-41
%   6. If a question does not have parts, then first delete lines 43-69
%   
%   7. Create versions of the question when possible. Use commands defined in 
%      tufte-tweaks.sty to do so. Its easier than you think

\question Find the equation of the straight lines parallel to $\vbone x - \vbtwo y + \vbthree = 0$ 
and at a distance of $\vbfour$ units from it

\begin{solution}
	The distance between two parallel lines - $Ax + By + C_1 = 0$ and $Ax+By+C_2 = 0$ is given by 
	$d = \dfrac{\vert C_1 - C_2 \vert}{\sqrt{1 + m^2}}$. Note that there would be \textit{two} such lines, 
	one on either side of the original line. So,
	\begin{align}
		\vbfour &= \dfrac{\vert \vbthree - C_2 \vert}{\sqrt{1 + \left( \frac{\vbone}{\vbtwo}\right)^2}} \\
		\Rightarrow \vbthree - C_2 &= \vbsix, \text{ for when } C_2 < \vbthree \\
		\text{ and } C_2 - \vbthree &= \vbsix, \text{ for when } C_2 > \vbthree
	\end{align}
	Solving (2) and (3) above, we get 
	\begin{align}
		C_2 &= \vbseven \text{ and } C_2 = \vbeight
	\end{align}
	
	Hence, the two lines are $\vbone x - \vbtwo y + \vbseven = 0$ and $\vbone x - \vbtwo y + \vbeight = 0$
\end{solution}
