% Now, down to brasstacks. ** Writing good solutions is an Art **. 
% Eventually, you will find your own style. But here are some thoughts 
% to get you started: 
%
%   1. Write the solution as if you are writing it for your favorite
%      14-17 year old to help him/her understand. Could be your nephew, 
%      your niece, a cousin perhaps or probably even you when you 
%      were that age. Just write for them.
%
%   2. Use margin-notes to "talk" to students about the critical insights
%      in the question. The tone can be - in fact, should be - informal
%
%   3. Don't shy away from creating margin-figures you think will help
%      students understand. Yes, it is a little more work per question. 
%      But the question & solution will be written only once. Make that
%      attempt at writing a solution count.
%
%   4. At the same time, do not be too verbose. A long solution can
%      - at first sight - make the student think, "God, that is a lot to know".
%      Our aim is not to scare students. Rather, our aim should be to 
%      create many "Aha!" moments everyday in classrooms around the world
% 
%   5. Ensure that there are *no spelling mistakes anywhere*. We are an 
%      education company. Bad spellings suggest that we ourselves 
%      don't have any education. Also, use American spellings by default
% 
%   6. If a question has multiple parts, then first delete lines 40-41
%   7. If a question does not have parts, then first delete lines 43-69

\question What are the maximum and minimum values of the function $f(\theta) = \sin^4\theta + \cos^4\theta$?

\begin{solution}
  The \textit{extrema} - that is, maxima or minima - will happen at points where,
  \begin{align}
     \dfrac{\ud}{\ud\theta}f(\theta) = 4\sin^3\theta\cos\theta - 4\cos^3\theta\sin\theta &= 0\\
        \Rightarrow 4\sin\theta\cos\theta\cdot(\sin^2\theta - \cos^2\theta) &= 0 \\
        \text{which will happen when } \sin\theta = 0 \Rightarrow \theta &= n\pi \\
              \cos\theta = 0 \Rightarrow \theta &= (2n+1)\frac{\pi}{2} \\
        \text{or, when } \sin^2\theta = \cos^2\theta \Rightarrow \theta &= (2n+1)\frac{\pi}{4}
  \end{align}
  We only need to find the extreme values, \textit{not} where they occur. And so, if we take $\theta$s
  conforming to the above - like $\theta = 0$, $\theta = \frac{\pi}{4}$ and $\theta = \frac{\pi}{2}$, then
  that should be enough to tell us what the extreme values are
  
  \begin{align}
     f(0) = f(\frac{\pi}{2}) &= 1 \\
     \text{and } f(\frac{\pi}{4}) &= \dfrac{1}{2}
  \end{align}
  The maximum value is therefore $1$ and the minimum is $\frac{1}{2}$
\end{solution}
