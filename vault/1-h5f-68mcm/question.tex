% Now, down to brasstacks. ** Writing good solutions is an Art **. 
% Eventually, you will find your own style. But here are some thoughts 
% to get you started: 
%
%   1. Write the solution as if you are writing it for your favorite
%      14-17 year old to help him/her understand. Could be your nephew, 
%      your niece, a cousin perhaps or probably even you when you 
%      were that age. Just write for them.
%
%   2. Use margin-notes to "talk" to students about the critical insights
%      in the question. The tone can be - in fact, should be - informal
%
%   3. Don't shy away from creating margin-figures you think will help
%      students understand. Yes, it is a little more work per question. 
%      But the question & solution will be written only once. Make that
%      attempt at writing a solution count.
%
%   4. At the same time, do not be too verbose. A long solution can
%      - at first sight - make the student think, "God, that is a lot to know".
%      Our aim is not to scare students. Rather, our aim should be to 
%      create many "Aha!" moments everyday in classrooms around the world
% 
%   5. Ensure that there are *no spelling mistakes anywhere*. We are an 
%      education company. Bad spellings suggest that we ourselves 
%      don't have any education. Also, use American spellings by default
% 
%   6. If a question has multiple parts, then first delete lines 40-41
%   7. If a question does not have parts, then first delete lines 43-69

\question Without using a calculator, find the value of $\tan\dfrac{\pi}{8}$

\begin{solution}
	\begin{align}
		\tan\dfrac{\pi}{4} = \tan \left(2\cdot\dfrac{\pi}{8}\right) &= \dfrac{2\tan\dfrac{\pi}{8}}{1-\tan^2\dfrac{\pi}{8}} \\
		\Rightarrow \tan^2\dfrac{\pi}{8} + 2\tan\dfrac{\pi}{8} - 1 &= 0 \\
		\Rightarrow\tan\dfrac{\pi}{8} = \dfrac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 - 4\cdot(-1)}}{2} &= (\sqrt{2}-1)\text{ or }-(\sqrt{2}+1)
	\end{align}
	As $\tan\theta > 0 \,\forall \,\theta \in (0,\dfrac{\pi}{2})$, $\tan\dfrac{\pi}{8}$ can only be equal to
	$\sqrt{2}-1$
\end{solution}
