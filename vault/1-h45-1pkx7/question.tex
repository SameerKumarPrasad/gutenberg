% Now, down to brasstacks. ** Writing good solutions is an Art **. 
% Eventually, you will find your own style. But here are some thoughts 
% to get you started: 
%
%   1. Write the solution as if you are writing it for your favorite
%      14-17 year old to help him/her understand. Could be your nephew, 
%      your niece, a cousin perhaps or probably even you when you 
%      were that age. Just write for them.
%
%   2. Use margin-notes to "talk" to students about the critical insights
%      in the question. The tone can be - in fact, should be - informal
%
%   3. Don't shy away from creating margin-figures you think will help
%      students understand. Yes, it is a little more work per question. 
%      But the question & solution will be written only once. Make that
%      attempt at writing a solution count.
%
%   4. At the same time, do not be too verbose. A long solution can
%      - at first sight - make the student think, "God, that is a lot to know".
%      Our aim is not to scare students. Rather, our aim should be to 
%      create many "Aha!" moments everyday in classrooms around the world
% 
%   5. Ensure that there are *no spelling mistakes anywhere*. We are an 
%      education company. Bad spellings suggest that we ourselves 
%      don't have any education. Also, use American spellings by default
% 
%   6. If a question has multiple parts, then first delete lines 40-41
%   7. If a question does not have parts, then first delete lines 43-69

\question If $\cos^{-1} x + \cos^{-1} y + \cos^{-1} z = 3\pi$, then what is the value 
of $xy + yz + zx$?

\begin{solution}
	\textit{By definition}, $\cos^{-1} A \in [0,\pi]$ where $A \in [-1,1]$. Which means, 
	that the maximum value of $\cos^{-1} A$ is $\pi$
	
	So, if you have got 3 terms adding up to 3 times the maximum value of an individual term, 
	then each term \textit{must also be} at its maximum value. Otherwise, one or more terms 
	will have to be greater than the maximum value (not possible) to compensate for a value 
	that is less than the maximum
	
	\begin{align}
		\Rightarrow \cos^{-1} x &= \cos^{-1} y = \cos^{-1} z = \pi \\
		\therefore x &= y = z = \cos\pi = -1 \\
		\Rightarrow xy + yz + zx &= -1\cdot -1 + -1\cdot -1 + -1\cdot -1 = 3
	\end{align}
\end{solution}
