% Now, down to brasstacks. ** Writing good solutions is an Art **. 
% Eventually, you will find your own style. But here are some thoughts 
% to get you started: 
%
%   1. Write to be understood - but be crisp. Your own solution should not take 
%      more space than you will give to the student. Hence, if you take more than 
%      a half-page to write a solution, then give the student a full-page and so on...
%
%   2. Use margin-notes to "talk" to students about the critical insights
%      in the question. The tone can be - in fact, should be - informal
%
%   3. Don't shy away from creating margin-figures you think will help
%      students understand. Yes, it is a little more work per question. 
%      But the question & solution will be written only once. Make that
%      attempt at writing a solution count.
%      
%      3b. Use bc_to_fig.tex. Its an easier way to generate plots & graphs 
% 
%   4. Ensure that there are *no spelling mistakes anywhere*. We are an 
%      education company. Bad spellings suggest that we ourselves 
%      don't have any education. Also, use American spellings by default
% 
%   5. If a question has multiple parts, then first delete lines 40-41
%   6. If a question does not have parts, then first delete lines 43-69
%   
%   7. Create versions of the question when possible. Use commands defined in 
%      tufte-tweaks.sty to do so. Its easier than you think

\question There is no snow on Janet's driveway when snow begins to fall at midnight.
From midnight to $9$ A.M., snow accumulates on the driveway at a rate modeled by
$f(t) = 7te^{\cos t}$ cubic feet per hour, where $t$ is measured in hours since midnight.
Janet starts removing snow at $6$ A.M. $(t=6)$. The rate $g(t)$ in cubic feet per hour
at which Janet removes the snow from the driveway at time $t$ hours after midnight is
modelled by \\
\textit{Use of calculator is permitted for this questions}
\begin{align}
  g(t) = \left\{
  \begin{tabular}{cc}
    $0$   &$\text{for }0 \leq \text{t} < 6$ \\
    $125$ &$\text{for }6 \leq \text{t} < 7$ \\ 
    $108$ &$\text{for }7 \leq \text{t} \leq 9$
  \end{tabular} \nonumber

\begin{parts}
  \part How many cubic feet of snow have accumulated on the driveway by $6$ A.M.?
  \begin{solution}
    To find volume $V$ of snow accumulated we integrate rate function $f(t)$ over time
    from $t=0$ to $t=6$.
    \begin{align}
      \text{V} = \int_0^6 f(t)\ud t = 142.274
    \end{align}  
  \end{solution}

  \part Find the rate of change of the Volume of snow on the driveway at $8$ A.M.?
  \begin{solution}
    To find rate of change of Volume of snow we subtract rate at which snow is being 
    cleared from the rate at which snow is falling,
    \begin{align}
      f(8) - g(8) = -59.58 \textit{ (cubic feet per hour)} \nonumber
    \end{align}
    This implies that the snow is being cleared faster than it is falling!
  \end{solution}

  \part Let $h(t)$ represent the total amount of snow in cubic feet that Janet has
  removed from the driveway at time $t$ hours after midnight. Express $h$ as a piecewise
  defined function with domain $0 \leq t \leq 9$.
  \begin{solution}
    Let us define $h$ as a piecewise function with domains that align with the given 
    model.\\
    For $0 < t \leq 6$,
    \begin{align}
      h(t) = h(0) + \int_0^t g(s)\ud s = 0 + \int_0^t 0\ud s = 0
    \end{align}
    For $6 < t \leq 7$,
    \begin{align}
      h(t) = h(6) + \int_6^t g(s)\ud s = 0 + \int_6^t 125 \ud s = 125(t - 6)
    \end{align}
    For $7 < t \leq 9$,
    \begin{align}
      h(t) = h(7) + \int_7^t g(s)\ud s = 125 + \int_6^t 108 \ud s = 125 + 108(t - 7)
    \end{align}
    Therefore,
    \begin{align}
      h(t) = \left\{
      \begin{tabular}{ll}
        $0$            &for $0 \leq t \leq 6$ \\
        $125(t-6)$     &for $6 < t \leq 7$ \\
        $125+108(t-7)$ &for $7 < t \leq 9$
      \end{tabular}
      \right.
    \end{align}
  \end{solution}

  \part How many cubic feet of snow are on the driveway at $9$ A.M.?
  \begin{solution}
    Amount A, in \textit{cubic feet} of snow on the driveway $A$ at $9$ A.M.,
    \begin{align}
      \text{A} &= \int_0^9 f(t)\ud t - h(9) \\ \nonumber
               &= 367.334 - 341 = 26.334 \textit{ (cubic feet)}
    \end{align}
  \end{solution}
