% This is an empty shell file placed for you by the 'examiner' script.
% You can now fill in the TeX for your question here.

% Now, down to brasstacks. ** Writing good solutions is an Art **. 
% Eventually, you will find your own style. But here are some thoughts 
% to get you started: 
%
%   1. Write the solution as if you are writing it for your favorite
%      14-17 year old to help him/her understand. Could be your nephew, 
%      your niece, a cousin perhaps or probably even you when you 
%      were that age. Just write for them.
%
%   2. Use margin-notes to "talk" to students about the critical insights
%      in the question. The tone can be - in fact, should be - informal
%
%   3. Don't shy away from creating margin-figures you think will help
%      students understand. Yes, it is a little more work per question. 
%      But the question & solution will be written only once. Make that
%      attempt at writing a solution count.
%
%   4. At the same time, do not be too verbose. A long solution can
%      - at first sight - make the student think, "God, that is a lot to know".
%      Our aim is not to scare students. Rather, our aim should be to 
%      create many "Aha!" moments everyday in classrooms around the world
% 
%   5. Ensure that there are *no spelling mistakes anywhere*. We are an 
%      education company. Bad spellings suggest that we ourselves 
%      don't have any education. Also, use American spellings by default
% 
%   6. If a question has multiple parts, then first delete lines 40-41
%   7. If a question does not have parts, then first delete lines 43-69

\question How many different mixed-gender comittees of 3 people can be chosen from a group of $5$ men and $5$ women.

\insertQR{}

\ifprintanswers
  % stuff to be shown only in the answer key - like explanatory margin figures
\fi 

\begin{solution}
  Total number of all $3$ member comittees that can be chosen from a group of $10$
  \begin{align}
    N_{total} = C^{10}_3 \nonumber
  \end{align}
  Total number of $3$ member male only comittees that can be chosen is
  \begin{align}
    N_{male} = C^{5}_3 \nonumber
  \end{align}
  By symmetry, same is the case for number of female only comittees $N_{female}$.
  
  Therefore number of mixed gender comittees is,
  \begin{align}
    N_{mixed} &= N_{total} - (N_{male}+N_{female}) \nonumber \\
              &= C^{10}_3 - 2(C^5_3) \nonumber \\
              &= 80 \nonumber
  \end{align}
\end{solution}
