% Now, down to brasstacks. ** Writing good solutions is an Art **. 
% Eventually, you will find your own style. But here are some thoughts 
% to get you started: 
%
%   1. Write to be understood - but be crisp. Your own solution should not take 
%      more space than you will give to the student. Hence, if you take more than 
%      a half-page to write a solution, then give the student a full-page and so on...
%
%   2. Use margin-notes to "talk" to students about the critical insights
%      in the question. The tone can be - in fact, should be - informal
%
%   3. Don't shy away from creating margin-figures you think will help
%      students understand. Yes, it is a little more work per question. 
%      But the question & solution will be written only once. Make that
%      attempt at writing a solution count.
%      
%      3b. Use bc_to_fig.tex. Its an easier way to generate plots & graphs 
% 
%   4. Ensure that there are *no spelling mistakes anywhere*. We are an 
%      education company. Bad spellings suggest that we ourselves 
%      don't have any education. Also, use American spellings by default
% 
%   5. If a question has multiple parts, then first delete lines 40-41
%   6. If a question does not have parts, then first delete lines 43-69
%   
%   7. Create versions of the question when possible. Use commands defined in 
%      tufte-tweaks.sty to do so. Its easier than you think

\begin{solution}[\halfpage]
	The $m^{\text{th}}$ term in the expansion is of the form 
	\begin{align}
	   a_m &= \encr{\vbthree}{m}\cdot\left( \vbone x \right)^{m}\cdot\left( -\vbtwo\cdot\dfrac{1}{x}\right)^{\vbthree - m} \\
	   &= \encr{\vbthree}{m}\cdot\left(\vbone\right)^{m}\cdot\left( -\vbtwo \right)^{\vbthree - m}\times\dfrac{x^m}{x^{\vbthree - m}}
	\end{align}
	We will get a $x^{\vbfour}$ term when 
	\begin{align}
		\dfrac{x^m}{x^{\vbthree - m}} &= x^{\vbfour} \Rightarrow 2m - \vbthree = \vbfour \Rightarrow m = \tp
	\end{align}
	And the \textit{coefficient} then would be 
	\begin{align}
		C_{\tp} &= \encr{\vbthree}{\tp}\cdot\left(\vbone\right)^{\tp}\cdot\left( -\vbtwo \right)^{\vbthree - \tp} \\
		&= \vbfive
	\end{align}
\end{solution}
