% This is an empty shell file placed for you by the 'examiner' script.
% You can now fill in the TeX for your question here.

% Now, down to brasstacks. ** Writing good solutions is an Art **. 
% Eventually, you will find your own style. But here are some thoughts 
% to get you started: 
%
%   1. Write the solution as if you are writing it for your favorite
%      14-17 year old to help him/her understand. Could be your nephew, 
%      your niece, a cousin perhaps or probably even you when you 
%      were that age. Just write for them.
%
%   2. Use margin-notes to "talk" to students about the critical insights
%      in the question. The tone can be - in fact, should be - informal
%
%   3. Don't shy away from creating margin-figures you think will help
%      students understand. Yes, it is a little more work per question. 
%      But the question & solution will be written only once. Make that
%      attempt at writing a solution count.
%
%   4. At the same time, do not be too verbose. A long solution can
%      - at first sight - make the student think, "God, that is a lot to know".
%      Our aim is not to scare students. Rather, our aim should be to 
%      create many "Aha!" moments everyday in classrooms around the world
% 
%   5. Ensure that there are *no spelling mistakes anywhere*. We are an 
%      education company. Bad spellings suggest that we ourselves 
%      don't have any education. And, use American spellings

\question[4]  Prove that
	\begin{align}
		\dfrac{\sin 2\theta -\sin 3\theta +\sin 4\theta}
			  {\cos 2\theta -\cos 3\theta +\cos 4\theta} = \tan 3\theta \nonumber

  \marginnote[1cm] {Key insight is that since the angle on the Right Hand Side is $3\theta$, try and convert terms on the Left Hand Side to $3 \theta$ as well.}
\fi 

\begin{solution}[\halfpage]
	Start with the Left Hand Side (LHS),
	\begin{align}
		\text{LHS} &= \dfrac{\sin 2\theta -\sin 3\theta +\sin 4\theta}
			    		    {\cos 2\theta -\cos 3\theta +\cos 4\theta} \\
			       &= \dfrac{\sin \left(3\theta - \theta\right) + 
			       			 \sin \left(3\theta + \theta\right) - \sin 3\theta}
			       			{\cos \left(3\theta - \theta\right) + 
			       			 \cos \left(3\theta + \theta\right) - \cos 3\theta} \\
			       &= \dfrac{2\sin 3\theta\cos \theta -\sin 3\theta}
			       			{2\cos 3\theta\cos \theta - \cos 3\theta} \\
			       &= \dfrac{\sin 3\theta}{\cos 3\theta} = \tan 3\theta
	\end{align}
\end{solution}
