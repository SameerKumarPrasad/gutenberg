% Now, down to brasstacks. ** Writing good solutions is an Art **. 
% Eventually, you will find your own style. But here are some thoughts 
% to get you started: 
%
%   1. Write the solution as if you are writing it for your favorite
%      14-17 year old to help him/her understand. Could be your nephew, 
%      your niece, a cousin perhaps or probably even you when you 
%      were that age. Just write for them.
%
%   2. Use margin-notes to "talk" to students about the critical insights
%      in the question. The tone can be - in fact, should be - informal
%
%   3. Don't shy away from creating margin-figures you think will help
%      students understand. Yes, it is a little more work per question. 
%      But the question & solution will be written only once. Make that
%      attempt at writing a solution count.
%
%   4. At the same time, do not be too verbose. A long solution can
%      - at first sight - make the student think, "God, that is a lot to know".
%      Our aim is not to scare students. Rather, our aim should be to 
%      create many "Aha!" moments everyday in classrooms around the world
% 
%   5. Ensure that there are *no spelling mistakes anywhere*. We are an 
%      education company. Bad spellings suggest that we ourselves 
%      don't have any education. Also, use American spellings by default
% 
%   6. If a question has multiple parts, then first delete lines 40-41
%   7. If a question does not have parts, then first delete lines 43-69

\question[4] The sum of $n$ terms of a sequence is defined by the formula $S_n=2n^2+3n$. Prove that it is an arithmetic progression.

\begin{solution}[\halfpage]
  A series is an arithmetic progression if its sum can be expressed in the form $S = \dfrac{n}{2}(2A + (n-1)D$ where $A$ is the initial term, $n$ is the number of terms and $D$ is the common difference. \\
  Let us consider the given expression $S_n$,
  \begin{align}
    S_n &= 2n^2 + 3n \\
        &= n(2n + 3) \\
        &= \dfrac{n}{2}(4n + 6 - 4 + 4) \\
        &= \dfrac{n}{2}(2(5) + (n-1)4)
  \end{align}
  Comparing equation (4) with the general form for sum of an arithmetic progression, we can conclude that the given expression represents the sum of a series with initial term $5$ and common difference $4$.
