% Now, down to brasstacks. ** Writing good solutions is an Art **. 
% Eventually, you will find your own style. But here are some thoughts 
% to get you started: 
%
%   1. Write the solution as if you are writing it for your favorite
%      14-17 year old to help him/her understand. Could be your nephew, 
%      your niece, a cousin perhaps or probably even you when you 
%      were that age. Just write for them.
%
%   2. Use margin-notes to "talk" to students about the critical insights
%      in the question. The tone can be - in fact, should be - informal
%
%   3. Don't shy away from creating margin-figures you think will help
%      students understand. Yes, it is a little more work per question. 
%      But the question & solution will be written only once. Make that
%      attempt at writing a solution count.
%
%   4. At the same time, do not be too verbose. A long solution can
%      - at first sight - make the student think, "God, that is a lot to know".
%      Our aim is not to scare students. Rather, our aim should be to 
%      create many "Aha!" moments everyday in classrooms around the world
% 
%   5. Ensure that there are *no spelling mistakes anywhere*. We are an 
%      education company. Bad spellings suggest that we ourselves 
%      don't have any education. Also, use American spellings by default
% 
%   6. If a question has multiple parts, then first delete lines 40-41
%   7. If a question does not have parts, then first delete lines 43-69

\question[3] Find an expression for the sum of the first $n$ terms of the series 
$\dfrac{1}{1\cdot 3} + \dfrac{1}{3\cdot 5} + \dfrac{1}{5\cdot 7} + \ldots$

\begin{solution}[\halfpage]
	Each term in the above series is of the form $a_n = \dfrac{1}{(2n-1)\cdot(2n+1)}$. Hence, the
	sum of the first $n$ terms is
	\begin{align}
		S_n &= \sum_{k=1}^{n}\dfrac{1}{(2n-1)\cdot(2n+1)} = 
		\sum_{k=1}^{n}\dfrac{1}{2}\cdot\dfrac{(2n+1)-(2n-1)}{(2n+1)\cdot(2n-1)} \\
		&= \dfrac{1}{2}\cdot\left[ \sum_{k=1}^{n}\dfrac{1}{2n-1} - \sum_{k=1}^{n}\dfrac{1}{2n+1}\right] \\
		&= \dfrac{1}{2}\cdot\left[ \left( 1 + \dfrac{1}{3} + \dfrac{1}{5} + \ldots + \dfrac{1}{2n-1}\right)
		 - \left( \dfrac{1}{3} + \dfrac{1}{5} + \ldots + \dfrac{1}{2n-1} + \dfrac{1}{2n+1} \right)\right] \\
		 &= \dfrac{1}{2}\cdot\left( 1-\dfrac{1}{2n+1}\right) = \dfrac{n}{2n+1}
	\end{align}
\end{solution}
