% Now, down to brasstacks. ** Writing good solutions is an Art **. 
% Eventually, you will find your own style. But here are some thoughts 
% to get you started: 
%
%   1. Write the solution as if you are writing it for your favorite
%      14-17 year old to help him/her understand. Could be your nephew, 
%      your niece, a cousin perhaps or probably even you when you 
%      were that age. Just write for them.
%
%   2. Use margin-notes to "talk" to students about the critical insights
%      in the question. The tone can be - in fact, should be - informal
%
%   3. Don't shy away from creating margin-figures you think will help
%      students understand. Yes, it is a little more work per question. 
%      But the question & solution will be written only once. Make that
%      attempt at writing a solution count.
%
%   4. At the same time, do not be too verbose. A long solution can
%      - at first sight - make the student think, "God, that is a lot to know".
%      Our aim is not to scare students. Rather, our aim should be to 
%      create many "Aha!" moments everyday in classrooms around the world
% 
%   5. Ensure that there are *no spelling mistakes anywhere*. We are an 
%      education company. Bad spellings suggest that we ourselves 
%      don't have any education. And, use American spellings

\question[2] A man invests \texteuro 10,000 in an account that pays 8.5\% 
per annum compounded quarterly. How much interest would the man have earned 
after 3 years?

\begin{solution}[\halfpage]
	\begin{align}
		P_{\texttt{3}} &= P_{\texttt{0}}\cdot\left( 1 + \dfrac{R}{N}\right)^{N\times T}
	\end{align}
	where,
	\begin{align}
		N &= \text{\# of compounding periods per year} = 4 \\
		R &= \text{annualized rate of interest} = 8.5\% = 0.085 \\
		T &= \text{investment period} = \text{3 years}
	\end{align}
	
	Therefore,
	\begin{align}
		P_{\texttt{3}} &= \text{\texteuro}10,000\cdot\left( 1 + \dfrac{0.085}{4}\right)^{4\times 3} \\
		               &= \text{\texteuro} 12,870.19 \\
		\Rightarrow I_{\texttt{3}} &= P_{\texttt{3}} - P_{\texttt{0}} = \text{\texteuro} 2,870.19
	\end{align}
	
\end{solution}
