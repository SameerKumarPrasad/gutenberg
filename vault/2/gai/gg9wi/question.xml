    <tex>\text{Reshma wishes to mix two types of food, P and Q, in}\\
\text{such a way that the vitamin contents of the mixture}\\
\text{contain at least 8 units of vitamin A and 11 units of}\\
\text{vitamin B. Food P costs Rs. 60/kg and food Q costs}\\
\text{Rs. 80/kg. Food P contains 3 units/kg of vitamin A and}\\
\text{5 units/kg of vitamin B, while food Q contains 4 units/kg}\\
\text{of vitamin A and 2 units/kg of vitamin B. Determine the}\\
\text{minimum cost of the mixture.}</tex>

    <context>\text{If the quantity of P be x(kg) and the quantity of Q}\\

C = x(kg)\cdot 60(Rs/kg)+y(kg)\cdot 80(Rs/kg)</tex>

C = (x(kg)+y(kg))\cdot\dfrac{60+80}{2}(Rs/kg)</tex>

\qquad x(kg)\cdot 3(units/kg)+y(kg)\cdot 4(units/kg) \ge 8 \\
