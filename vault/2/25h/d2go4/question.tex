% This is an empty shell file placed for you by the 'examiner' script.
% You can now fill in the TeX for your question here.

% Now, down to brasstacks. ** Writing good solutions is an Art **. 
% Eventually, you will find your own style. But here are some thoughts 
% to get you started: 
%
%   1. Write the solution as if you are writing it for your favorite
%      14-17 year old to help him/her understand. Could be your nephew, 
%      your niece, a cousin perhaps or probably even you when you 
%      were that age. Just write for them.
%
%   2. Use margin-notes to "talk" to students about the critical insights
%      in the question. The tone can be - in fact, should be - informal
%
%   3. Don't shy away from creating margin-figures you think will help
%      students understand. Yes, it is a little more work per question. 
%      But the question & solution will be written only once. Make that
%      attempt at writing a solution count.
%
%   4. At the same time, do not be too verbose. A long solution can
%      - at first sight - make the student think, "God, that is a lot to know".
%      Our aim is not to scare students. Rather, our aim should be to 
%      create many "Aha!" moments everyday in classrooms around the world
% 
%   5. Ensure that there are *no spelling mistakes anywhere*. We are an 
%      education company. Bad spellings suggest that we ourselves 
%      don't have any education. Also, use American spellings by default
% 
%   6. If a question has multiple parts, then first delete lines 40-41
%   7. If a question does not have parts, then first delete lines 43-69

  \dfrac{1-\cos2\theta+\sin2\theta}
    {1+\cos2\theta+\sin2\theta} = \tan\theta

\begin{solution}[\halfpage]
  Expand the Left Hand Side (L.H.S),
  \begin{align}
    \text{L.H.S} &= \dfrac{1-\cos^2\theta+\sin^2\theta+
                            2\sin\theta\cos\theta}
                          {1+\cos^2\theta-\sin^2\theta+
                            2\sin\theta\cos\theta} \\
                 &= \dfrac{2\sin^2\theta+2\sin\theta\cos\theta}
                            {2\cos^2\theta+2\sin\theta\cos\theta} \\
                 &= \tan\theta
  \end{align}
