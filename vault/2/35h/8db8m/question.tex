% Now, down to brasstacks. ** Writing good solutions is an Art **. 
% Eventually, you will find your own style. But here are some thoughts 
% to get you started: 
%
%   1. Write the solution as if you are writing it for your favorite
%      14-17 year old to help him/her understand. Could be your nephew, 
%      your niece, a cousin perhaps or probably even you when you 
%      were that age. Just write for them.
%
%   2. Use margin-notes to "talk" to students about the critical insights
%      in the question. The tone can be - in fact, should be - informal
%
%   3. Don't shy away from creating margin-figures you think will help
%      students understand. Yes, it is a little more work per question. 
%      But the question & solution will be written only once. Make that
%      attempt at writing a solution count.
%
%   4. At the same time, do not be too verbose. A long solution can
%      - at first sight - make the student think, "God, that is a lot to know".
%      Our aim is not to scare students. Rather, our aim should be to 
%      create many "Aha!" moments everyday in classrooms around the world
% 
%   5. Ensure that there are *no spelling mistakes anywhere*. We are an 
%      education company. Bad spellings suggest that we ourselves 
%      don't have any education. Also, use American spellings by default
% 
%   6. If a question has multiple parts, then first delete lines 40-41
%   7. If a question does not have parts, then first delete lines 43-69

           {$\tan 3\theta = \tan (\theta + 2\theta) \\
            = \dfrac{\tan\theta +\tan 2\theta}
                    {1 -\tan\theta\tan 2\theta} \\
            = \dfrac{\tan\theta(1 - \tan ^2\theta) + 2\tan \theta}
                    {(1 - \tan ^2\theta) - 2\tan ^2 \theta} \\

\begin{solution}[\halfpage]
  Let $20^\circ=\theta$. Then $40^\circ$ can be written as $60^\circ -\theta$ and $80^\circ$ can be written as $60^\circ +\theta$. Now, we can rewrite the expression as,
  \begin{align}
    P &= \tan\theta\tan(\dfrac{\pi}{3}-\theta)
    	   \tan(\dfrac{\pi}{3}+\theta) \\
      &= \tan\theta
           \left(\dfrac{tan(\dfrac{\pi}{3})-\tan\theta}
                       {1+\tan(\dfrac{\pi}{3})\tan\theta}\right)
           \left(\dfrac{tan(\dfrac{\pi}{3})+\tan\theta}
                       {1-\tan(\dfrac{\pi}{3})\tan\theta}\right) \\
      &= \tan\theta
           \left(\dfrac{tan^2(\dfrac{\pi}{3})-\tan^2\theta}
                       {1-\tan^2(\dfrac{\pi}{3})\tan^2\theta}\right) \\
      &= \tan\theta
           \left(\dfrac{3-\tan^2\theta}
                       {1-3\tan^2\theta}\right) \\
      &= \dfrac{3\tan\theta-\tan^3\theta}{1-3\tan^2\theta} \\
      &= \tan 3\theta \\
      &= \sqrt{3}
  \end{align}
