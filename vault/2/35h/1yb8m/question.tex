% This is an empty shell file placed for you by the 'examiner' script.
% You can now fill in the TeX for your question here.

% Now, down to brasstacks. ** Writing good solutions is an Art **. 
% Eventually, you will find your own style. But here are some thoughts 
% to get you started: 
%
%   1. Write the solution as if you are writing it for your favorite
%      14-17 year old to help him/her understand. Could be your nephew, 
%      your niece, a cousin perhaps or probably even you when you 
%      were that age. Just write for them.
%
%   2. Use margin-notes to "talk" to students about the critical insights
%      in the question. The tone can be - in fact, should be - informal
%
%   3. Don't shy away from creating margin-figures you think will help
%      students understand. Yes, it is a little more work per question. 
%      But the question & solution will be written only once. Make that
%      attempt at writing a solution count.
%
%   4. At the same time, do not be too verbose. A long solution can
%      - at first sight - make the student think, "God, that is a lot to know".
%      Our aim is not to scare students. Rather, our aim should be to 
%      create many "Aha!" moments everyday in classrooms around the world
% 
%   5. Ensure that there are *no spelling mistakes anywhere*. We are an 
%      education company. Bad spellings suggest that we ourselves 
%      don't have any education. Also, use American spellings by default
% 
%   6. If a question has multiple parts, then first delete lines 40-41
%   7. If a question does not have parts, then first delete lines 43-69

\question[5] Without resorting to a calculator or tables, verify
\begin{align}
  \dfrac{1}{\cos 290^\circ}+\dfrac{1}{\sqrt{3}\sin 250^\circ} 
    = \dfrac{4}{\sqrt{3}} \nonumber
\end{align}

  % stuff to be shown only in the answer key - like explanatory margin figures
  \begin{marginfigure}
    \figinit{pt}
      \figpt 100:(0,0)
      \figpt 101:(0,0)
    \figdrawbegin{}
      \figdrawline [100,101]
    \figdrawend
    \figvisu{\figBoxA}{}{%
    }
    \centerline{\box\figBoxA}
  \end{marginfigure}
\fi 


\begin{solution}[\fullpage]
  \begin{align}     
    290^\circ &= \left(\dfrac{3\pi}{2}+\dfrac{\pi}{9}\right) 
      \text{radians} \\
    250^\circ &= \left(\dfrac{3\pi}{2}-\dfrac{\pi}{9}\right) 
      \text{radians}
  \end{align}
  Therefore Left Hand Side (L.H.S) may be rewritten as,
  \begin{align}
    \text{L.H.S} &= \dfrac{1}{\cos(\dfrac{3\pi}{2}+\dfrac{\pi}{9})}+
      				  \dfrac{1}{\sqrt{3}
      				    \sin(\dfrac{3\pi}{2}-\dfrac{\pi}{9})} \\
      		     &= \dfrac{1}{\sin\dfrac{\pi}{9}}-
      				  \dfrac{1}{\sqrt{3}\cos\dfrac{\pi}{9}} \\
      		     &= \dfrac{\sqrt{3}\cos\dfrac{\pi}{9}-\sin\dfrac{\pi}{9}}
      		              {\sqrt{3}\cos\dfrac{\pi}{9}\sin\dfrac{\pi}{9}} \\
      		     &= \dfrac{4}{\sqrt{3}}\left(
      		          \dfrac{\dfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\cos\dfrac{\pi}{9}-
      		                         \dfrac{1}{2}\sin\dfrac{\pi}{9}}
            		               {2\cos\dfrac{\pi}{9}
            		                 \sin\dfrac{\pi}{9}}\right) \\
      		     &= \dfrac{4}{\sqrt{3}}\left(
      		          \dfrac{\sin(\dfrac{\pi}{3}-\dfrac{\pi}{9})}
      		                {\sin\dfrac{2\pi}{9}}\right) \\
      		     &= \dfrac{4}{\sqrt{3}}
  \end{align}
\end{solution}
