% Now, down to brasstacks. ** Writing good solutions is an Art **. 
% Eventually, you will find your own style. But here are some thoughts 
% to get you started: 
%
%   1. Write to be understood - but be crisp. Your own solution should not take 
%      more space than you will give to the student. Hence, if you take more than 
%      a half-page to write a solution, then give the student a full-page and so on...
%
%   2. Use margin-notes to "talk" to students about the critical insights
%      in the question. The tone can be - in fact, should be - informal
%
%   3. Don't shy away from creating margin-figures you think will help
%      students understand. Yes, it is a little more work per question. 
%      But the question & solution will be written only once. Make that
%      attempt at writing a solution count.
%      
%      3b. Use bc_to_fig.tex. Its an easier way to generate plots & graphs 
% 
%   4. Ensure that there are *no spelling mistakes anywhere*. We are an 
%      education company. Bad spellings suggest that we ourselves 
%      don't have any education. Also, use American spellings by default
% 
%   5. If a question has multiple parts, then first delete lines 40-41
%   6. If a question does not have parts, then first delete lines 43-69
%   
%   7. Create versions of the question when possible. Use commands defined in 
%      tufte-tweaks.sty to do so. Its easier than you think

\question[2] How many 3-digit $\vbone$ numbers less than $\vbthree$ can be 
 formed using the digits $\vbtwo$ - if repetition of digits is allowed

		\end{tabular}

\fi 

\begin{solution}[\mcq]
  The table above shows the digits that can appear in the units, tens and 
  hundreds places so that all conditions are satisified (number < $\vbthree$ and 
  number is \vbone)

	Therefore, the number of ways of creating a valid number are
  \begin{align}
    \text{\# of ways} &= \underbrace{2}_{\texttt{units}}\times\underbrace{4}_{\texttt{tens}}\times\underbrace{1}_{\texttt{hundreds}} \\
    &= 8
  \end{align} 
\end{solution}
