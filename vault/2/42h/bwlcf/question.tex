\begin{solution}[\halfpage]
  Let the common ration of the progression be $r$ and the total number of terms be $n(even)$. The progression comprising only the odd terms would have common ration $r^2$ and number of terms $n/2$. \\
  \begin{align}
    S_{full} &= a\dfrac{r^n-1}{r-1} \\
    S_{odd}  &= a\dfrac{{r^2}^{n/2}-1}{r^2-1}
  \end{align}
  Let the ratio of the sums of series be $R$.
  \begin{align}
    R &= \dfrac{S_{full}}{S_{odd}} \\
      &= \dfrac{a\dfrac{r^n-1}{r-1}}{a\dfrac{{r^2}^{n/2}-1}{r^2-1}} \\
      &= \dfrac{r^n-1}{r-1}\dfrac{(r-1)(r+1)}{r^n-1} \\
      &= r + 1
  \end{align}
  Therefore, for any common ration $r$, the sum of all terms in the series is $r+1$ times the sum of the odd terms.
\end{solution}
