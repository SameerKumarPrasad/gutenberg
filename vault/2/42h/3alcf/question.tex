\begin{solution}[\halfpage]
  Let the three numbers be $\dfrac{a}{r}$, $a$ and $ar$. The conditions we have been given are:
  \begin{align}
    \dfrac{a}{r} + a + ar                       &= 13 \\
    \dfrac{a^2}{r^2} + a^2 + {ar}^2 &= 91
  \end{align}

  Consider equation (1) and take square on both sides,
  \begin{align}
    a^2(\dfrac{1}{r} + 1 + r)^2 &= 169
  \end{align}
  
  Subtract equation (2) from equation (3),
  \begin{align}
    a^2(\dfrac{1}{r} + 1 + r)^2 - a^2(\dfrac{1}{r^2} + 1 + r^2) &= 169 - 91 \\
                                                                 a(\dfrac{a}{r} + a + ar) &= 39
  \end{align}
  
  Substitute equation (1) into equation (5),
  \begin{align}
    a = 3
  \end{align}  
  
  Substitute the value of $a$ into equation (1),
  \begin{align}
    \dfrac{3}{r} + 3 + 3r &= 13 \\
    (3r - 1)(r - 3)                &= 0
  \end{align}  
  
  $r$ may be equal to $\dfrac{1}{3}$ or $3$. Either way the numbers would be $1$, $3$ and $9$.
  
\end{solution}
