\begin{solution}[\halfpage]
  \begin{align}
  	A &= 17 + 4n_1, n_1 \in Z\\
  	B &= 16 + 5n_2, n_2 \in Z \\
  	\text{Common terms when } 17+4n_1 &= 16+5n_2 \\ 
  	\text{ or, when } n_2 = \dfrac{1}{5}(4n_1 + 1)
  \end{align}
  Now, if $n_2$ is an integer, then $(4n_1+1)$ must be a multiple of 5 $\Rightarrow (4n_1+1)$
  must end in either a 0 or a 5 $\Rightarrow 4n_1$ must end in a 9 or a 4
  
  No multiple of 4 can end in a 9. However, numbers of the form $4\times (5k+1), k \in Z$
  will end in a 4
  
  And so, terms in $A$ where $n_1 = 5k+1, k \in Z$ would also be found in $B$
  
  The \textit{common} terms are therefore
  \begin{align}
  	C_k &= 17 + 4\cdot(5k + 1) = 21 + 20k \\
  \end{align}
  This looks like another series where the first term is 21 and the common difference is 20
  
  And hence, the sum of the first 10 terms is
  \begin{align}
  	S_{10} &= \dfrac{10}{2}\cdot\left[ 2\cdot 21 + (10-1)\cdot 20 \right] \\
  	       &= 1110
  \end{align}
\end{solution}
