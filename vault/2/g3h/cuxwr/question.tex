\question[3] A train was delayed by a semaphore for $16min$. It made up for the delay along a section of $80km$ length, traveling $10km/h$ higher than its scheduled speed. Find the scheduled speed of the train. \textit{A semaphore allows a train to enter a critical section of track where only one train can go at a time. (speed = distance/time)}.

\begin{solution}[\halfpage]
  Let us assume that the scheduled speed of the train is $v(km/h)$. \\
  Since the train made up for the delay, we can equate the time it would have taken if it traveled as per schedule with the time it actually took.
  \begin{align}
    T_{scheduled}           &= T_{delay} + T_{catch up} \\
    \dfrac{80(km)}{v(km/h)} &= \dfrac{16(min)}{60(min/h)}+\dfrac{80(km)}{v+10(km/h)} \\
    &\Rightarrow \dfrac{5}{v} = \dfrac{1}{60}+\dfrac{5}{v+10} \\
    &\Rightarrow v^2+10v-3000 = 0 \\
    &\Rightarrow v            = 50,-60
  \end{align}
  Rejecting the negative value, the scheduled normal speed of the train is $50km/h$.
\end{solution}
