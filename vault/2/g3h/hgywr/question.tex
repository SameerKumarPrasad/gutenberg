\question[4] Two dots zip along the circumference of a circle. If they move in opposite directions they meet every $15sec$ whereas if they move in the same direction then meet every $60sec$. If the circumference of the circle is $1.2m$, calculate the speed of the dots? \textit{(Use speed = distance/time)}

\begin{solution}[\halfpage]
  Let the speeds of the dots be $v_1(m/sec)$ and $v_2(m/sec)$. To meet the dots have to traverse the circumference of the circle. Therefore,
  \begin{align}
    \dfrac{1.2(m)}{15(sec)} &= v_1(m/sec)+v_2(m/sec) 
	\quad\quad\textit{(opp. directions)} \\
    \dfrac{1.2(m)}{60(sec)} &= v_1(m/sec)-v_2(m/sec) 
	\quad\quad\textit{(same direction)}
  \end{align}
  Add equation (1) and (2), 
  \begin{align}
    \dfrac{1.2}{15}+\dfrac{1.2}{60} &= 2v_1 \\
    v_1                             &= 0.05 \\
    v_2                             &= 0.03
  \end{align}
  The speeds of the dots are $0.05(m/sec)$ and $0.03(m/sec)$.
\end{solution}
