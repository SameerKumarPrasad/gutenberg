    <context>\text{Does this plot correctly represent the } \\

    <image correct='true'>1a.svg</image>
    <image>1b.svg</image>
    <reason>\text{Given the constraints the area would be }\\
\text{below } x+2y=120 \text{ but above }x+y=60 \\
\text{Further since }x-2y\text{ needs to be positive, }\\
\text{therefore it would also need to be below }x-2y=0\\
\text{since that is where x would be greater than 2y}</reason>
