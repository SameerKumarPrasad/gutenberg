\begin{solution}[\halfpage]
  Let us begin by expanding the left hand side (LHS) of the equation and try to prove it equal to the right hand side.
  
  \begin{align}
    \text{LHS}  &= (1+\cot A+\tan A)(\sin A-\cos A) \\
	   	&= \sin A+\cos A+\tan A\sin A- \nonumber \\
		&\quad\quad \cos A-\cot A\cos A-\sin A \\
		&= (\sin A\tan A-\cot A\cos A)
  \end{align}

\end{solution}
