% This is an empty shell file placed for you by the 'examiner' script.
% You can now fill in the TeX for your question here.

% Now, down to brasstacks. ** Writing good solutions is an Art **. 
% Eventually, you will find your own style. But here are some thoughts 
% to get you started: 
%
%   1. Write the solution as if you are writing it for your favorite
%      14-17 year old to help him/her understand. Could be your nephew, 
%      your niece, a cousin perhaps or probably even you when you 
%      were that age. Just write for them.
%
%   2. Use margin-notes to "talk" to students about the critical insights
%      in the question. The tone can be - in fact, should be - informal
%
%   3. Don't shy away from creating margin-figures you think will help
%      students understand. Yes, it is a little more work per question. 
%      But the question & solution will be written only once. Make that
%      attempt at writing a solution count.
%
%   4. At the same time, do not be too verbose. A long solution can
%      - at first sight - make the student think, "God, that is a lot to know".
%      Our aim is not to scare students. Rather, our aim should be to 
%      create many "Aha!" moments everyday in classrooms around the world
% 
%   5. Ensure that there are *no spelling mistakes anywhere*. We are an 
%      education company. Bad spellings suggest that we ourselves 
%      don't have any education. Also, use American spellings by default
% 
%   6. If a question has multiple parts, then first delete lines 40-41
%   7. If a question does not have parts, then first delete lines 43-69

\begin{solution}[\halfpage]
	\begin{align}
	    \text{We know that}\quad
		\fSumOfSin{3x}{x} \nonumber \\
		\Rightarrow (\sin 3x + \sin x)\sin x 
			= 2\sin{2x}\cdot\cos{x}\cdot\sin{x}\\
	    \text{Similarly,}\quad
		\fDiffOfCos{3x}{x} \nonumber \\
		\Rightarrow (\cos 3x-\cos x)\cdot\cos x 
			= 2\sin{2x}\cdot(-\sin x)\cdot\cos x
	\end{align}
	Add (1) and (2) to get the original equation.
\end{solution}
