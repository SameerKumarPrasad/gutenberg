\question[5] Consider the following B+ tree with degree $d = 2$.
\\
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
  \hline
      & 7 &  & 25 &  & 35 &  &  &   \\
  \hline
\end{tabular}
\begin{align}
 \nonumber
\end{align}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}
    3  & 4  & 5  & 6 
\end{tabular}
\begin{tabular}{c|c|c|c|}
    \quad  8 & 10  & 17  & 19 
\end{tabular}
\begin{tabular}{c|c|c|c|}
    \quad  28 & 33  &   &   
\end{tabular}
\begin{tabular}{c|c|c|c|}
    \quad  42 & 52 &  &  
\end{tabular}

Draw the $B+$ Tree after inserting $34$, $2$ and $15$ (draw only one B+ tree 
after $3$ insertions). Draw the $B+$ Tree after deleting $28$ and $8$ (the 
deletion happens after the $3$ insertions of $34$, $2$ and $15$). Draw only 
one $B+$ tree after deleting $8$. Maintain at least $50$\% occupancy at each 
step. In the diagram above we have not shown pointers in the leaf nodes for 
simplicity but remember that the leaf nodes are linked lists. Root node can 
have $1$ to $2$d keys.
