\question[4] Suppose you want to index fixed length records,
each $256$ bytes long. They key of each record being $4$ bytes
long. Records are stored on disk so that they do not cross
page boundaries. If you use a \textit{three-level} $B^{+}$ tree 
to index this file, with the records themselves occupying the 
third level of the tree (records are in the node of the tree), 
then what is the maximum number of records you can index. The 
$B^{+}$ tree pointers are $4096$ bytes long?
