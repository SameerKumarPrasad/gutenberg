\question[5] Suppose that we are using extendable hashing on a file that contains 
records with the following search-key values:
\begin{align}
  3, 8, 11, 14, 15, 16, 17, 19, 20, 33, 43, 48
\end{align}

Show the final \textit{extendable hash structure} for this file if the hash function is 
$h(x) = x mod 7$ $(Example H(8) = 1 = 00001)$, and buckets can hold $3$ records each. 
You need to use the suffix (for example, $01$ is the $2$ bit suffix in $00001$) for 
inserting records in the buckets. The records are inserted in the order: 
\begin{align}
  3, 8, 11, 14, 15, 16, 17, 19, 20, 33, 43, 48
\end{align}
