% Now, down to brasstacks. ** Writing good solutions is an Art **. 
% Eventually, you will find your own style. But here are some thoughts 
% to get you started: 
%
%   1. Write the solution as if you are writing it for your favorite
%      14-17 year old to help him/her understand. Could be your nephew, 
%      your niece, a cousin perhaps or probably even you when you 
%      were that age. Just write for them.
%
%   2. Use margin-notes to "talk" to students about the critical insights
%      in the question. The tone can be - in fact, should be - informal
%
%   3. Don't shy away from creating margin-figures you think will help
%      students understand. Yes, it is a little more work per question. 
%      But the question & solution will be written only once. Make that
%      attempt at writing a solution count.
%
%   4. At the same time, do not be too verbose. A long solution can
%      - at first sight - make the student think, "God, that is a lot to know".
%      Our aim is not to scare students. Rather, our aim should be to 
%      create many "Aha!" moments everyday in classrooms around the world
% 
%   5. Ensure that there are *no spelling mistakes anywhere*. We are an 
%      education company. Bad spellings suggest that we ourselves 
%      don't have any education. Also, use American spellings by default
% 
%   6. If a question has multiple parts, then first delete lines 40-41
%   7. If a question does not have parts, then first delete lines 43-69

\question[3] Rafael Nadal is poised to meet either Roger Federer or Novak 
Djokovic in the French Open finals. Nadal's record, on clay, against Federer is 
$10-2$, which means that Nadal has won 10 of their last 12 matches on clay. Nadal's 
record against Djokovic - on clay - is $1-6$. Federer and Djokovic have equal chances of
beating each other in the other semi-final. What is the probability that Nadal will win 
the French Open?

\begin{solution}[\halfpage]
  Let $P_{W}$ be the probability that Nadal wins the title, 
$P_{N-Bt-D}$ be the probablity that he beats Djokovic and $P_{N-Bt-F}$  
be the probability that he wins against Federer, then 
   
  \begin{align}
    P_{W} &= \dfrac{1}{2}(P_{N-Bt-D}) + \dfrac{1}{2}(P_{N-Bt-F}) \\
   	  &= \dfrac{1}{2}(\dfrac{1}{6}) + \dfrac{1}{2}(\dfrac{5}{6}) \\ 
   	  &= \dfrac{1}{2}
  \end{align}
  Therefore Nadal has a $50\%$ chance of winning the French Open.     
\end{solution}
