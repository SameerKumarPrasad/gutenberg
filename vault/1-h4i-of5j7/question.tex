% This is an empty shell file placed for you by the 'examiner' script.
% You can now fill in the TeX for your question here.

% Now, down to brasstacks. ** Writing good solutions is an Art **. 
% Eventually, you will find your own style. But here are some thoughts 
% to get you started: 
%
%   1. Write the solution as if you are writing it for your favorite
%      14-17 year old to help him/her understand. Could be your nephew, 
%      your niece, a cousin perhaps or probably even you when you 
%      were that age. Just write for them.
%
%   2. Use margin-notes to "talk" to students about the critical insights
%      in the question. The tone can be - in fact, should be - informal
%
%   3. Don't shy away from creating margin-figures you think will help
%      students understand. Yes, it is a little more work per question. 
%      But the question & solution will be written only once. Make that
%      attempt at writing a solution count.
%
%   4. At the same time, do not be too verbose. A long solution can
%      - at first sight - make the student think, "God, that is a lot to know".
%      Our aim is not to scare students. Rather, our aim should be to 
%      create many "Aha!" moments everyday in classrooms around the world
% 
%   5. Ensure that there are *no spelling mistakes anywhere*. We are an 
%      education company. Bad spellings suggest that we ourselves 
%      don't have any education. Also, use American spellings by default
% 
%   6. If a question has multiple parts, then first delete lines 40-41
%   7. If a question does not have parts, then first delete lines 43-69

\begin{solution}
   Let the LHS be $= X$. Multiply and divide $X$ with $2$ so that, 
   \begin{fullwidth}
   	  \begin{align}
   	      X &= \dfrac{2\sin A\sin 2A + 2\sin 3A\sin 6A + 2\sin 4A\sin 13A}
{2\sin A\cos 2A + 2\sin 3A\cos 6A + 2\sin 4A\cos 13A} \\
            &= \dfrac{(\cos\dfrac{3A}{2} - \cos\dfrac{A}{2}) + 
            (\cos\dfrac{9A}{2} - \cos\dfrac{3A}{2}) + 
            (\cos\dfrac{17A}{2} - \cos\dfrac{9A}{2})}
                     {(\sin 3A - \sin A) + 
                     (\sin 9A - \sin 3A) + 
                     (\sin 17A - \sin 9A)} \\
            &= \dfrac{\cos\dfrac{17A}{2} - \cos\dfrac{A}{2}}{\sin 17A - \sin A} \\
            &= \dfrac{2\cdot\sin 9A\sin 8A}{2\cdot\cos 9A\sin 8A} \\
            &= \tan 9A
   	  \end{align}
   \end{fullwidth}
