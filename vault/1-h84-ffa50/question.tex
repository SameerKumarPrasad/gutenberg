% This is an empty shell file placed for you by the 'examiner' script.
% You can now fill in the TeX for your question here.

% Now, down to brasstacks. ** Writing good solutions is an Art **. 
% Eventually, you will find your own style. But here are some thoughts 
% to get you started: 
%
%   1. Write to be understood - but be crisp. Your own solution should not take 
%      more space than you will give to the student. Hence, if you take more than 
%      a half-page to write a solution, then give the student a full-page and so on...
%
%   2. Use margin-notes to "talk" to students about the critical insights
%      in the question. The tone can be - in fact, should be - informal
%
%   3. Don't shy away from creating margin-figures you think will help
%      students understand. Yes, it is a little more work per question. 
%      But the question & solution will be written only once. Make that
%      attempt at writing a solution count.
%      
%      3b. Use bc_to_fig.tex. Its an easier way to generate plots & graphs 
% 
%   4. Ensure that there are *no spelling mistakes anywhere*. We are an 
%      education company. Bad spellings suggest that we ourselves 
%      don't have any education. Also, use American spellings by default
% 
%   5. If a question has multiple parts, then first delete lines 40-41
%   6. If a question does not have parts, then first delete lines 43-69
%   
%   7. Create versions of the question when possible. Use commands defined in 
%      tufte-tweaks.sty to do so. Its easier than you think

\question[3] If the line joining the points $A = (\vbone, \vbtwo)$ and $B = (\vbthree, \vbfour)$ 
\ is rotated \textit{counter-clockwise} about $A$ by $\ang{15}$, then what is the equation 
of the resulting new line ?

\begin{solution}[\halfpage]
    First, the slope of $AB$ is given by 
    \begin{align}
        m &= \tan\theta = \dfrac{\vbfour - \vbtwo}{\vbthree - \vbone} = \vbfive \\
        \Rightarrow \theta &= \ang{\vbsix}
    \end{align}
    The slope of the \textit{new} line would therefore be $ = \tan(\theta + \ang{15}) = \vbseven$. Its equation
    , therefore, would be 
    \begin{align}
      \fEqnSlope &= \vbseven \text{ where } (x_1, y_1) = A = (\vbone, \vbtwo) \\
      \Rightarrow y &= \vbseven\cdot x + (\vbtwo - \vbone\cdot\vbseven) \\
      &= \vbseven\cdot x + \vbeight
    \end{align}
\end{solution}
