% This is an empty shell file placed for you by the 'examiner' script.
% You can now fill in the TeX for your question here.

% Now, down to brasstacks. ** Writing good solutions is an Art **. 
% Eventually, you will find your own style. But here are some thoughts 
% to get you started: 
%
%   1. Write the solution as if you are writing it for your favorite
%      14-17 year old to help him/her understand. Could be your nephew, 
%      your niece, a cousin perhaps or probably even you when you 
%      were that age. Just write for them.
%
%   2. Use margin-notes to "talk" to students about the critical insights
%      in the question. The tone can be - in fact, should be - informal
%
%   3. Don't shy away from creating margin-figures you think will help
%      students understand. Yes, it is a little more work per question. 
%      But the question & solution will be written only once. Make that
%      attempt at writing a solution count.
%
%   4. At the same time, do not be too verbose. A long solution can
%      - at first sight - make the student think, "God, that is a lot to know".
%      Our aim is not to scare students. Rather, our aim should be to 
%      create many "Aha!" moments everyday in classrooms around the world
% 
%   5. Ensure that there are *no spelling mistakes anywhere*. We are an 
%      education company. Bad spellings suggest that we ourselves 
%      don't have any education. Also, use American spellings by default
% 
%   6. If a question has multiple parts, then first delete lines 40-41
%   7. If a question does not have parts, then first delete lines 43-69

\question[3] How many ways can eight people sit in a circle if Alice and Bob must sit next to each other?

  % stuff to be shown only in the answer key - like explanatory margin figures
\fi 

\begin{solution}[\halfpage]
  One way to think about the problem is, let Alice and Bob together be effectively one person(Alice-Bob or Bob-Alice). \\
  Now, number of ways we can arrange $7$ people in a circle = $6!$ \\
  Number of ways Alice and Bob can sit next to each other = $2$. \\
  Therefore number of ways the group can be arranged is given by, 
  \begin{align}
    \text{No. of ways} &= 6!\times 2 \nonumber \\
                       &= 1440 \nonumber
  \end{align}
  
  Another way to think about the problem is, fix Alice's spot on the circle. \\
  Number of spots available for Bob = $2$ \\
  Number of spots available for the others = $6!$ \\
  Again total number of ways the group can be arranged is $6!\times2$ which is $1440$    
  
\end{solution}
