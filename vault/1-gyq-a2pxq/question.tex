% Now, down to brasstacks. ** Writing good solutions is an Art **. 
% Eventually, you will find your own style. But here are some thoughts 
% to get you started: 
%
%   1. Write the solution as if you are writing it for your favorite
%      14-17 year old to help him/her understand. Could be your nephew, 
%      your niece, a cousin perhaps or probably even you when you 
%      were that age. Just write for them.
%
%   2. Use margin-notes to "talk" to students about the critical insights
%      in the question. The tone can be - in fact, should be - informal
%
%   3. Don't shy away from creating margin-figures you think will help
%      students understand. Yes, it is a little more work per question. 
%      But the question & solution will be written only once. Make that
%      attempt at writing a solution count.
%
%   4. At the same time, do not be too verbose. A long solution can
%      - at first sight - make the student think, "God, that is a lot to know".
%      Our aim is not to scare students. Rather, our aim should be to 
%      create many "Aha!" moments everyday in classrooms around the world
% 
%   5. Ensure that there are *no spelling mistakes anywhere*. We are an 
%      education company. Bad spellings suggest that we ourselves 
%      don't have any education. And, use American spellings

\question[2] Find the value of $k$, if $x+1$ is a factor of $4x^3+3x^2-4x+k$

\ifprintanswers
  % stuff to be shown only in the answer key - like explanatory margin figures
  \marginnote[5cm] {There is nothing special about choosing the second \& third terms
  as $4x+a$ and $x+b$ respectively}

  \marginnote[0.25cm] {You could just as well have said that the second \& third terms
  are $2x+a$ and $2x+b$}

  \marginnote[0.25cm] { The values of $a$ and $b$ would have changed, but the resulting
  factors would be the same} 
  
  \marginnote[0.25cm] {The only important point to note is that whatever
  be the factors, the coefficient of $x^3$ has to be equal to $4$ }

\begin{solution}
	There are two approaches to solving this problem. The first uses the fact
	that if $(x-a)$ is a factor of some polynomial equation $f(x)$, then $f(a) = 0$.
	Lets start with that
	
	If $(x+1)$ is a factor, then $4x^3+3x^2-4x+k = 0 $ for $x = -1$
	\begin{align}
		& \Rightarrow 4\cdot(-1)^3+3\cdot(-1)^2-4\cdot(-1)+k = 0 \\
		& \Rightarrow k + 3 = 0 \\
		& \Rightarrow k = -3
	\end{align}
	
	The second solution, on the other hand, uses what it means for something
	to be a factor of a polynomial
	
	So, if $(x+1)$ is a factor of $4x^3+3x^2-4x+k$, then 
	\begin{align}
		4x^3+3x^2-4x+k &= (x+1)\cdot(4x+a)\cdot(x+b) \\
					   &= \underbrace{(4x^2+ax+4x+a)}_\texttt{first two factors}\cdot(x+b) \\
					   &= 4x^3+(a+4b+4)x^2+(a+4b+ab)x+ab \\
	\end{align}	 
	Its the same equation on both sides. So, their coefficients should also be the same
	\begin{align}
		\Rightarrow a+4b+4 &= 3 \Rightarrow a + 4b = -1\\
		            a+4b+ab &= -4 \Rightarrow ab = -3\\
		            ab &= k \Rightarrow k = -3
	\end{align}
	
\end{solution}
\marginnote[-3cm]{ Solve for $a$ and $b$, plug their values into (4) and you would know
all the factors of this expression}
