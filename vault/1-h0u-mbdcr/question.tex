% This is an empty shell file placed for you by the 'examiner' script.
% You can now fill in the TeX for your question here.

% Now, down to brasstacks. ** Writing good solutions is an Art **. 
% Eventually, you will find your own style. But here are some thoughts 
% to get you started: 
%
%   1. Write the solution as if you are writing it for your favorite
%      14-17 year old to help him/her understand. Could be your nephew, 
%      your niece, a cousin perhaps or probably even you when you 
%      were that age. Just write for them.
%
%   2. Use margin-notes to "talk" to students about the critical insights
%      in the question. The tone can be - in fact, should be - informal
%
%   3. Don't shy away from creating margin-figures you think will help
%      students understand. Yes, it is a little more work per question. 
%      But the question & solution will be written only once. Make that
%      attempt at writing a solution count.
%
%   4. At the same time, do not be too verbose. A long solution can
%      - at first sight - make the student think, "God, that is a lot to know".
%      Our aim is not to scare students. Rather, our aim should be to 
%      create many "Aha!" moments everyday in classrooms around the world
% 
%   5. Ensure that there are *no spelling mistakes anywhere*. We are an 
%      education company. Bad spellings suggest that we ourselves 
%      don't have any education. Also, use American spellings by default
% 
%   6. If a question has multiple parts, then first delete lines 40-41
%   7. If a question does not have parts, then first delete lines 43-69

\begin{solution}[\fullpage]
	The two parabolas intersect at points where
	\begin{align}
	   x^2-6x+10 &= 6x-x^2 \\
	   \Rightarrow 2x^2 - 12x + 10 &= 0 \\
	   \Rightarrow x &= 1,5
	\end{align}
	
	The required area $A$ of region $R$ is therefore
	\begin{align}
	  A &= \int_1^5 [(6x-x^2) - (x^2 - 6x + 10)] \ud x \\
	    &= \int_1^5 (12x - 2x^2 -10) \ud x \\
	    &= \left[ 6x^2 -\dfrac{2}{3}x^3 - 10x\right]_1^5 \\
	    &= \left( 150 - \frac{250}{3} -50\right) - \left( 6 - \frac{2}{3} - 10\right) \\
	    &= 104 - \frac{248}{3} = 21\frac{1}{3}
	\end{align}
