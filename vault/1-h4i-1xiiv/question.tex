% This is an empty shell file placed for you by the 'examiner' script.
% You can now fill in the TeX for your question here.

% Now, down to brasstacks. ** Writing good solutions is an Art **. 
% Eventually, you will find your own style. But here are some thoughts 
% to get you started: 
%
%   1. Write the solution as if you are writing it for your favorite
%      14-17 year old to help him/her understand. Could be your nephew, 
%      your niece, a cousin perhaps or probably even you when you 
%      were that age. Just write for them.
%
%   2. Use margin-notes to "talk" to students about the critical insights
%      in the question. The tone can be - in fact, should be - informal
%
%   3. Don't shy away from creating margin-figures you think will help
%      students understand. Yes, it is a little more work per question. 
%      But the question & solution will be written only once. Make that
%      attempt at writing a solution count.
%
%   4. At the same time, do not be too verbose. A long solution can
%      - at first sight - make the student think, "God, that is a lot to know".
%      Our aim is not to scare students. Rather, our aim should be to 
%      create many "Aha!" moments everyday in classrooms around the world
% 
%   5. Ensure that there are *no spelling mistakes anywhere*. We are an 
%      education company. Bad spellings suggest that we ourselves 
%      don't have any education. Also, use American spellings by default
% 
%   6. If a question has multiple parts, then first delete lines 40-41
%   7. If a question does not have parts, then first delete lines 43-69

\question The radius of a carriage wheel is \SI{50}{\centi\meter}, and in $\frac{1}{9}$th of 
a second it turns through $\ang{80}$ about its center, which is fixed. How many kilometers 
does a point on the rim of the wheel travel in one hour?

  \marginnote[1cm]{The question is a breeze if one is mindful of the units}
\fi 

\begin{solution}
    If $S$ be the speed of the carriage, then
	\begin{align}
	    S &= \dfrac{\frac{\ang{80}}{\ang{360}}\times\overbrace{\SI{50}{\centi\meter}}^{\text{0.5 m}}
	         \times2\pi}{\frac{1}{9}\si{\second}}
	         \times 3600\frac{\text{s}}{\text{hour}}
	         \times\dfrac{1}{1000}\frac{\text{km}}{\text{meter}} \\
	      &= 7.2\pi\si{\kilo\meter\per\hour} = \SI{22.62}{\kilo\meter\per\hour}
	\end{align}
\end{solution}
