% Now, down to brasstacks. ** Writing good solutions is an Art **. 
% Eventually, you will find your own style. But here are some thoughts 
% to get you started: 
%
%   1. Write to be understood - but be crisp. Your own solution should not take 
%      more space than you will give to the student. Hence, if you take more than 
%      a half-page to write a solution, then give the student a full-page and so on...
%
%   2. Use margin-notes to "talk" to students about the critical insights
%      in the question. The tone can be - in fact, should be - informal
%
%   3. Don't shy away from creating margin-figures you think will help
%      students understand. Yes, it is a little more work per question. 
%      But the question & solution will be written only once. Make that
%      attempt at writing a solution count.
%      
%      3b. Use bc_to_fig.tex. Its an easier way to generate plots & graphs 
% 
%   4. Ensure that there are *no spelling mistakes anywhere*. We are an 
%      education company. Bad spellings suggest that we ourselves 
%      don't have any education. Also, use American spellings by default
% 
%   5. If a question has multiple parts, then first delete lines 40-41
%   6. If a question does not have parts, then first delete lines 43-69
%   
%   7. Create versions of the question when possible. Use commands defined in 
%      tufte-tweaks.sty to do so. Its easier than you think

\question[2] A committee of $\vbone$ persons needs to be formed from amongst $\vbtwo$ people. However, 
Mr. X and Ms. Y do not like each other. And so, if one is picked, then the other cannot be. In how many 
ways then can the committee be formed?

\begin{solution}[\mcq]
	If Mr. X is picked, then Ms. Y is out of consideration $\Rightarrow$ $\tq$ out of $\tp$ 
	will remain to be picked. Same goes for if Ms. Y is picked first

  And then there are committees in which neither Mr. X \textit{nor} Ms. Y are members $\Rightarrow$ 
  $\vbone$ out of $\tp$ need to be picked
	
	\begin{align}
		N_{\texttt{total}} &= \overbrace{2\times\encr\tp\tq}^{\texttt{either picked}} + 
    \overbrace{\encr\tp\vbone}^{\texttt{neither picked}} \\
		&= \vbthree
	\end{align}
\end{solution}
