	\question[5] An urn contains 10 black balls and 5 white balls. Two(2) balls are
  drawn from the urn - one after the other - without replacement. What is the 
  probability that both the balls drawn are black?
  \begin{solution}[\halfpage]
    Probability that the first ball drawn is black = $P(E) = \dfrac{10}{15} = \dfrac{2}{3}$
    
    With the first ball out, probability that the second ball is black = $P(F) =
    \dfrac{9}{14}$

    $\therefore$, probability that both balls drawn first are black = $P(E)\cdot P(F)$

    \begin{align}
      &= \dfrac{2}{3} \cdot \dfrac{9}{14} \\
      &= \dfrac{3}{7}
    \end{align}
   \end{solution}
