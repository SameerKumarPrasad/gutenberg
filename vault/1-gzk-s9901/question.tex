% Now, down to brasstacks. ** Writing good solutions is an Art **. 
% Eventually, you will find your own style. But here are some thoughts 
% to get you started: 
%
%   1. Write the solution as if you are writing it for your favorite
%      14-17 year old to help him/her understand. Could be your nephew, 
%      your niece, a cousin perhaps or probably even you when you 
%      were that age. Just write for them.
%
%   2. Use margin-notes to "talk" to students about the critical insights
%      in the question. The tone can be - in fact, should be - informal
%
%   3. Don't shy away from creating margin-figures you think will help
%      students understand. Yes, it is a little more work per question. 
%      But the question & solution will be written only once. Make that
%      attempt at writing a solution count.
%
%   4. At the same time, do not be too verbose. A long solution can
%      - at first sight - make the student think, "God, that is a lot to know".
%      Our aim is not to scare students. Rather, our aim should be to 
%      create many "Aha!" moments everyday in classrooms around the world
% 
%   5. Ensure that there are *no spelling mistakes anywhere*. We are an 
%      education company. Bad spellings suggest that we ourselves 
%      don't have any education. And, use American spellings

\question[2] In the adjoining figure, $O$ is the center of the circle and $\angle BOC = \ang{100}$.
What is $\angle BDC$ equal to ?

\begin{solution}[\halfpage]
	If we pick a point $A$ on the circle's circumfrence, then $ACDB$ is a cyclic 
	quadrilateral in which,
	\begin{align}
		\angle BAC &= \dfrac{1}{2}\cdot\angle BOC = \ang{50}
	\end{align}
	Moreover, because it is a cyclic quadrilateral, 
	\begin{align}
		\angle BAC + \angle BDC &= \ang{180} \\
		\Rightarrow \angle BDC &= \ang{180} - \angle BAC = \ang{130}
	\end{align}
\end{solution}
