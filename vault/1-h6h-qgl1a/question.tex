% Now, down to brasstacks. ** Writing good solutions is an Art **. 
% Eventually, you will find your own style. But here are some thoughts 
% to get you started: 
%
%   1. Write the solution as if you are writing it for your favorite
%      14-17 year old to help him/her understand. Could be your nephew, 
%      your niece, a cousin perhaps or probably even you when you 
%      were that age. Just write for them.
%
%   2. Use margin-notes to "talk" to students about the critical insights
%      in the question. The tone can be - in fact, should be - informal
%
%   3. Don't shy away from creating margin-figures you think will help
%      students understand. Yes, it is a little more work per question. 
%      But the question & solution will be written only once. Make that
%      attempt at writing a solution count.
%
%   4. At the same time, do not be too verbose. A long solution can
%      - at first sight - make the student think, "God, that is a lot to know".
%      Our aim is not to scare students. Rather, our aim should be to 
%      create many "Aha!" moments everyday in classrooms around the world
% 
%   5. Ensure that there are *no spelling mistakes anywhere*. We are an 
%      education company. Bad spellings suggest that we ourselves 
%      don't have any education. Also, use American spellings by default
% 
%   6. If a question has multiple parts, then first delete lines 40-41
%   7. If a question does not have parts, then first delete lines 43-69


\question If the sum of the first $n$ terms of an A.P. is $pn + qn^2$, where $p$ 
and $q$ are known constants, then what is the common difference?

\begin{solution}
	\begin{align}
		\underbrace{S_{n+1} - S_n}_{n^{th} term} &= p(n+1) + q(n+1)^2 - [pn + qn^2] \\
		\Rightarrow \underbrace{a}_{?} + n\cdot\underbrace{d}_{?} &= (p+q) + 2qn \\
		\Rightarrow a &= (p+q) \text{ and } d = 2q
	\end{align}
\end{solution}
