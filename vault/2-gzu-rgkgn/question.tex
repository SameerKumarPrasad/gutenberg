% This is an empty shell file placed for you by the 'examiner' script.

% Now, down to brasstacks. ** Writing good solutions is an Art **. 
% Eventually, you will find your own style. But here are some thoughts 
% to get you started: 
%
%   1. Write the solution as if you are writing it for your favorite
%      14-17 year old to help him/her understand. Could be your nephew, 
%      your niece, a cousin perhaps or probably even you when you 
%      were that age. Just write for them.
%
%   2. Use margin-notes to "talk" to students about the critical insights
%      in the question. The tone can be - in fact, should be - informal
%
%   3. Don't shy away from creating margin-figures you think will help
%      students understand. Yes, it is a little more work per question. 
%      But the question & solution will be written only once. Make that
%      attempt at writing a solution count.
%
%   4. At the same time, do not be too verbose. A long solution can
%      - at first sight - make the student think, "God, that is a lot to know".
%      Our aim is not to scare students. Rather, our aim should be to 
%      create many "Aha!" moments everyday in classrooms around the world
% 
%   5. Ensure that there are *no spelling mistakes anywhere*. We are an 
%      education company. Bad spellings suggest that we ourselves 
%      don't have any education. And, use American spellings

\question[3] Suppose I want to have \$60,000.00 in my account for my children's college education. I expect to earn an average return of 12\%, compounding four times a year. If I deposit \$25,000.00 in my account today, how many years will it take me to meet my goal (\$60,000.00 in my account)?

\ifprintanswers
  % stuff to be shown only in the answer key - like explanatory margin figures
  \marginnote[2.2cm] {\textit{4y} since the interest is compounded 4 times a year}
\fi 

\begin{solution}
	Let us suppose it would take \textit{y} years,
	\begin{align}
	600000 &= 25000\left(1 + \dfrac{12}{100}\right)^{4y} \\
	   2.4 &= \left(\dfrac{112}{100}\right)^{4y} \\
	0.3802 &= 4y \left(\log 112 - 2\right) \\
		 y &= \dfrac{0.3802}{0.0492} \\
		 y &= 7.7248
	\end{align}
	It will take you 7.7 years to meet your goal. Keep slogging!
\end{solution}
