\question[3] If $a$, $b$ and $c$ in the equation of the line $ax+by+c=0$ are 
\textit{consecutive odd} integers, then prove that the line \textit{always} passes
through the point $(1,-2)$. Just to be clear, $a<b<c$

\begin{solution}[\halfpage]
  If $a$, $b$ and $c$ are consecutive odd integers, then $b = \dfrac{a+c}{2} 
  \Rightarrow a-2b+c = 0$
  
  Now this looks \textit{exactly} like the equation of the line for $(x,y) = (1,-2)$. And so,
   irrespective of what $a$, $b$ and $c$ are, the line $ax+by+c$ will always pass
   through $(1,-2)$ 
\end{solution}
