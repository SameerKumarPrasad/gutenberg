\begin{solution}[\halfpage]
  We are accustomed to seeing $y=f(x)$ - where $y$ is the dependent variable and 
  $x$ is the independent variable. 
  
  In this case, however, $x=f(y)$. To plot it (so that one can see the required area), 
  simply treat $y$ as the independent variable and $x$ as the dependent variable. 

  In other words, plot it like you would $y=x^2\cdot (x-\va)$ - but inter-change 
  the $y$ with the $x$. You will then get the figure in the margin. 

  The required area $(A)$ is of the bulge between $y=0$ and $y=\va$.
  \begin{align}
     A &= \int_0^{\va} y^2\cdot(y-\va)\ud y 
     = \int_0^{\va}\left(y^3-\va y^2\right)\ud y \\
       &= \left[ \dfrac{y^4}{4} - \dfrac{\va y^3}{3}\right]_0^{\va} = \WRITEFRAC\vm\vn
  \end{align}
  
  As area cannot be negative, $A=\WRITEFRAC\vo\vn$
\end{solution}
