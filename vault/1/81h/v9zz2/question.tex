  You don't have to know what the curve looks like exactly to solve the question. 
  But you can still infer three facts about the curve immediately
  \begin{align}
      x &= \left\lbrace
              \begin{array}{l c}
                 0 & \text{when }y=0,1 \\
                 > 0 & \text{when }y > 1 \\
                 < 0 & \text{when }y < 1
              \end{array}\right.
  \end{align}
  
  What this means is that the bulge whose area we have to calculate is 
  contained between $y=0$ and $y=1$, and that it is entirely in the 
  negative-$x$ region (so expect the integral to give a negative value)
  
  \begin{align}
     A &= \int_0^1 y^2\cdot(y-1)\ud y = \int_0^1(y^3-y^2)\ud y \\
       &= \left[ \dfrac{y^4}{4} - \dfrac{y^3}{3}\right]_0^1 \\
       &= -\dfrac{1}{12}
  \end{align}
  
  The required area is therefore $A = \frac{1}{12}$
\end{solution}
