\question[5] Any set $X_R$ - of type X - has $\va$ elements. Any set $Y_R$ - of type Y - has only $\vb$ elements. 
For every $x\in X_i$ (for some $i$), it is also true that $x\in Y_j$ (for some $j$) \textbf{and vice-versa}. 
Which means, there is a set $S$ such that,
    \[ S = \bigcup_{R=1}^{\vc} X_R = \bigcup_{R=1}^N Y_R\], 
where $\bigcup_{R=1}^{\vc} = X_1\cup X_2\cup X_3 \ldots\cup X_{\vc}$.

Now, if each element of $S$ belongs to exactly $\vd$ of the $X_R$s and to exactly 
$\ve$ of the $Y_R$s, then what is $N=?$

\begin{solution}[\fullpage]
  If there were no common elements between any of the $X_R$s - that is - 
  if $X_i\cap X_j = \phi,i\neq j$ for all pairs $(i,j)$, then $S$ would have 
  $=\vc\times\va = \vx$ elements

  But, we have been told that each element in $S$ belongs to exactly $\vd$ of the $X_R$s.
  Which means, $S$ has $ =\dfrac\vx\vd = \vunique$ \textbf{unique} elements

  Similarly, if $S$ is built from the $Y_R$s, then it would have $=\dfrac{\vb\times N}{\ve}$ 
  unique elements 

  But because it is the same set $S$, 
  \begin{align}
    \dfrac{\vb\times N}{\ve} &= \vunique \\
    \implies N &= \vy
  \end{align}
\end{solution}
