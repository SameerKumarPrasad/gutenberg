\question[5] At an international conference, there are $\vbone$ representatives of country A and $\vbtwo$ representatives 
of country B. In how many ways can they be seated along a table so that no two representatives of country $B$ 
are sitting together? You can leave your answer at the final expression

\begin{solution}[\halfpage]
	First, let the $\vbtwo$ representatives of country B sit down. Between them, there are $\midslots$ empty 
	slots where if we were to place a representative of country A, then no two of B would be sitting 
	together. The number of ways to do this are 
	
	\begin{align}
		N_1 &= \encr\vbone\midslots\times\midslots ! \times\vbtwo !
	\end{align}
	We still have $\remainingA$ representatives of country A to seat. But they can sit anywhere - 
	in the $\midslots$ slots between or in extreme left and extreme right slots. In short, there are 
	$\totalslots = (\midslots + 2)$ slots for them to be in 
	
	This is just like the problem of distributing $N$ things amonst $M$ people. In this case, we 
	have to dsitribute $\remainingA$ amongst $\totalslots$. And the formula for that is
	\begin{align}
		N_2 &= \eDistNAmongstM\remainingA\totalslots\times\remainingA !
	\end{align}
	The required answer, therefore, is 
	\begin{align}
		N_{\texttt{total}} &= N_1 \times N_2 \\ 
		&= \fncr\vbone\midslots\times\midslots ! \times\vbtwo ! \times \eDistNAmongstM\remainingA\totalslots\times\remainingA ! \\
		&= \dfrac{\vbone ! \times \tmp !}{\remainingA !} = \vbthree
	\end{align}
\end{solution}
