\gcalcexpr[0]\tmp{2 * \vbtwo}

\question[2] A city's metro network has $\vbone$ lines. On one of these lines, there are $\vbtwo$ 
possible \textit{fares} that can be charged - depending on which two stations one is going between.
 How many stations are there on this line?

\begin{solution}[\mcq]
   It is reasonable to assume that the fare between $A$ and $B$ is the same as that 
   between $B$ and $A$. And hence, if there be $N$ stations on the line, then
   \begin{align}
   		N_{\texttt{fares}} &= \encr{N}{2} = \vbtwo \\
   		\Rightarrow \fncr{N}{2} &= \vbtwo \text{ or } N\cdot(N-1) = \tmp \\
   		\Rightarrow N &= \vbthree
   \end{align}
\end{solution}
