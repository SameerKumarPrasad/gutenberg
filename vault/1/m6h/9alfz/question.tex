% Now, down to brasstacks. ** Writing good solutions is an Art **. 
% Eventually, you will find your own style. But here are some thoughts 
% to get you started: 
%
%   1. Write the solution as if you are writing it for your favorite
%      14-17 year old to help him/her understand. Could be your nephew, 
%      your niece, a cousin perhaps or probably even you when you 
%      were that age. Just write for them.
%
%   2. Use margin-notes to "talk" to students about the critical insights
%      in the question. The tone can be - in fact, should be - informal
%
%   3. Don't shy away from creating margin-figures you think will help
%      students understand. Yes, it is a little more work per question. 
%      But the question & solution will be written only once. Make that
%      attempt at writing a solution count.
%
%   4. At the same time, do not be too verbose. A long solution can
%      - at first sight - make the student think, "God, that is a lot to know".
%      Our aim is not to scare students. Rather, our aim should be to 
%      create many "Aha!" moments everyday in classrooms around the world
% 
%   5. Ensure that there are *no spelling mistakes anywhere*. We are an 
%      education company. Bad spellings suggest that we ourselves 
%      don't have any education. Also, use American spellings by default
% 
%   6. If a question has multiple parts, then first delete lines 40-41
%   7. If a question does not have parts, then first delete lines 43-69

\question[3] Find the sum of the first $n$ terms of the series $1^3 + 3^3 + 5^3 + 7^3 \ldots$ 

\insertQR{QRC}

\ifprintanswers
	\marginnote[3cm]{ $(a-b)^3 = a^3-3a^2b + 3ab^2 - b^3$ }
\fi 

\begin{solution}[\halfpage]
	If $a_n$ be the $n^{th}$ term of the series, then we can see that $a_n = (2k-1)^3,\, k \geq 1$.
	Hence, the sum of the first $n$ terms would be 
	\begin{align}
		S_n &= \sum_{k=1}^{n}(2k-1)^3 = \sum_{k=1}^{n}8k^3 - 
		\sum_{k=1}^{n}3\cdot 4k^2 + \sum_{k=1}^{n}3\cdot 2k - \sum_{k=1}^{n} 1 \\
		&= 8\cdot\eSumOfCubes{n} - 12\cdot\eSumOfSquares{n} + 6\cdot\eSumOfN{n} - n \\
		&= n\cdot(n+1)\cdot[2n\cdot(n+1) - 2\cdot(2n+1) + 3 ] - n \\
		&= n\cdot(n+1)\cdot(2n^2-2n+1) - n \\
    &= n\cdot\left[ (n+1)\cdot(2n^2-2n+1) - 1\right] \\
    &= n\cdot\left( 2n^3-2n^2+n + 2n^2-2n + 1 -1\right) = n\cdot(2n^3-n) \\
    &= n^2\cdot(2n^2-1)
	\end{align}
\end{solution}
