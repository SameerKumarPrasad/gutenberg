% Now, down to brasstacks. ** Writing good solutions is an Art **. 
% Eventually, you will find your own style. But here are some thoughts 
% to get you started: 
%
%   1. Write to be understood - but be crisp. Your own solution should not take 
%      more space than you will give to the student. Hence, if you take more than 
%      a half-page to write a solution, then give the student a full-page and so on...
%
%   2. Use margin-notes to "talk" to students about the critical insights
%      in the question. The tone can be - in fact, should be - informal
%
%   3. Don't shy away from creating margin-figures you think will help
%      students understand. Yes, it is a little more work per question. 
%      But the question & solution will be written only once. Make that
%      attempt at writing a solution count.
%      
%      3b. Use bc_to_fig.tex. Its an easier way to generate plots & graphs 
% 
%   4. Ensure that there are *no spelling mistakes anywhere*. We are an 
%      education company. Bad spellings suggest that we ourselves 
%      don't have any education. Also, use American spellings by default
% 
%   5. If a question has multiple parts, then first delete lines 40-41
%   6. If a question does not have parts, then first delete lines 43-69
%   
%   7. Create versions of the question when possible. Use commands defined in 
%      tufte-tweaks.sty to do so. Its easier than you think

\SUBTRACT\vbone\vbtwo\p

\question[3] What is the coefficient of $x^{\vbtwo} y^{\p}$ in the expansion of $(x + y)^{\vbone}$?

\begin{solution}[\halfpage]
  The general form of a term in the expansion of $(x+y)^{\vbone}$ is 
  \begin{align}
    a_m &= \encr\vbone{m}\cdot x^{m}\cdot y^{\vbone - m}, \text{where } m \in [0,\vbone]
  \end{align}

  What we need is $m=\vbtwo$ so that $x^m = x^{\vbtwo}$. Which means, that 
  \begin{align}
    a_{\vbtwo} &= \encr\vbone\vbtwo\cdot x^{\vbtwo}\cdot y^{\p}
  \end{align}

  And therefore, the required coefficient is simply
  \begin{align}
     = \encr\vbone\vbtwo  &= \fncr\vbone\vbtwo = \vbthree
  \end{align}
\end{solution}
