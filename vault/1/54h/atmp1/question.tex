\question[3] The total number of \textit{bijective} functions from set A to itself 
when A contains 106 elements is

	\marginnote{The question sounds way more complicated than it actually is. Basically
	we need to count the number of \textit{one-to-one} functions $f(x)$ that are 
	of the form $f:A\rightarrow A$}
	\marginnote[0.5cm]{One possible $f(x)$ could be $f(a_n) = a_n$ where $a_n \in A$. Another could be
	$f(a_n) = a_{n+1}$}
