\begin{solution}[\halfpage]
	\textit{By definition}, $\cos^{-1} A \in [0,\pi]$ where $A \in [-1,1]$. Which means, 
	that the maximum value of $\cos^{-1} A$ is $\pi$
	
	So, if you have got 3 terms adding up to 3 times the maximum value of an individual term, 
	then each term \textit{must also be} at its maximum value. Otherwise, one or more terms 
	will have to be greater than the maximum value (not possible) to compensate for a value 
	that is less than the maximum
	
	\begin{align}
		\Rightarrow \cos^{-1} x &= \cos^{-1} y = \cos^{-1} z = \pi \\
		\therefore x &= y = z = \cos\pi = -1 \\
		\Rightarrow xy + yz + zx &= -1\cdot -1 + -1\cdot -1 + -1\cdot -1 = 3
	\end{align}
\end{solution}
