\begin{solution}[\halfpage]
	The first such number is $101 = 3\times 33 + 2$. The last such number is $998 = 3\times 332 + 2$
	What does this mean? It means that to find the required sum, we should ignore the first $32$ such numbers
	and any number after the $332^{nd}$ one
	
	\begin{align}
		S &= S_{332} - S_{32} \\
		&= \sum_{k=32}^{332}(3n + 2) = \left[ 3\eSumOfN{n} + 2n \right]_{32}^{332} \\
		&= \left[ \dfrac{n}{2}\cdot(3n+7)\right]_{32}^{332} \\
		&= \dfrac{332}{2}\times 1003 - \dfrac{32}{2}\times 103 = 164,850
	\end{align}
\end{solution}
