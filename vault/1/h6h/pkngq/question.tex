\question[2] The sum $S_n$ of the first $n$ terms of an arithmetic progression is defined by
the formula $S_n = 4n^2-3n \,\forall n \geq 1$. What are the first three terms of the progression?

\begin{solution}[\halfpage]
	\begin{align}
		\underbrace{S_{n+1}-S_{n}}_{\text{(n+1)-th term}} &= 4\cdot(n+1)^2-3\cdot(n+1) - (4n^2-3n) \\
		\Rightarrow a + n\cdot d &= 4n^2+8n+4-3n-3-4n^2+3n = 1 + 8n \\
		\Rightarrow a = 1 \text{ and } d = 8
	\end{align}
	And therefore, the first three terms of the progression are $(1,9,17)$
\end{solution}
