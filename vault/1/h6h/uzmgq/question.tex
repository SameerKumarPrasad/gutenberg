% Now, down to brasstacks. ** Writing good solutions is an Art **. 
% Eventually, you will find your own style. But here are some thoughts 
% to get you started: 
%
%   1. Write the solution as if you are writing it for your favorite
%      14-17 year old to help him/her understand. Could be your nephew, 
%      your niece, a cousin perhaps or probably even you when you 
%      were that age. Just write for them.
%
%   2. Use margin-notes to "talk" to students about the critical insights
%      in the question. The tone can be - in fact, should be - informal
%
%   3. Don't shy away from creating margin-figures you think will help
%      students understand. Yes, it is a little more work per question. 
%      But the question & solution will be written only once. Make that
%      attempt at writing a solution count.
%
%   4. At the same time, do not be too verbose. A long solution can
%      - at first sight - make the student think, "God, that is a lot to know".
%      Our aim is not to scare students. Rather, our aim should be to 
%      create many "Aha!" moments everyday in classrooms around the world
% 
%   5. Ensure that there are *no spelling mistakes anywhere*. We are an 
%      education company. Bad spellings suggest that we ourselves 
%      don't have any education. Also, use American spellings by default
% 
%   6. If a question has multiple parts, then first delete lines 40-41
%   7. If a question does not have parts, then first delete lines 43-69

\question[3] If the $m^{th}$ term of an A.P is $\frac{1}{n}$ and the $n^{th}$ term is $\frac{1}{m}$, 
then prove that the sum of the first $mn$ terms is $\dfrac{1+mn}{2}$, given that $m \neq n$

\begin{solution}[\halfpage]
	\begin{align}
		\fTermOfAP{m} &= \frac{1}{n} \\
		\fTermOfAP{n} &= \frac{1}{m} \\
		\Rightarrow T_m - T_n = (m-n)\cdot d &= \frac{1}{n}-\frac{1}{m} = \dfrac{m-n}{mn} \\
		\Rightarrow d &= \dfrac{1}{mn}
	\end{align}
	And so,
	\begin{align}
		\fTermOfAP{m} &= a + (m-1)\cdot\dfrac{1}{mn} = \dfrac{1}{n} \\
		\Rightarrow amn + m - 1 &= mn \text{ or } a = \dfrac{1}{mn}
	\end{align}
	The sum of the first $mn$ terms therefore is,
	\begin{align}
		&\fSumOfAP{mn} = \dfrac{mn}{2}\cdot\left[ \dfrac{2}{mn} + (mn-1)\cdot\dfrac{1}{mn}\right] \\
		&= \dfrac{mn}{2}\cdot\left[ \dfrac{2 + mn - 1}{mn} \right] = \dfrac{1+mn}{2} 
	\end{align}
\end{solution}
