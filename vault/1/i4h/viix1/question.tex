\question[2] The radius of a carriage wheel is \SI{50}{\centi\meter}, and in $\frac{1}{9}$th of 
a second it turns through $\ang{80}$ about its center, which is fixed. How many kilometers 
does a point on the rim of the wheel travel in one hour?

\begin{solution}[\mcq]
    If $S$ be the speed of the carriage, then
	\begin{align}
	    S &= \dfrac{\frac{\ang{80}}{\ang{360}}\times\overbrace{\SI{50}{\centi\meter}}^{\text{0.5 m}}
	         \times2\pi}{\frac{1}{9}\si{\second}}
	         \times 3600\frac{\text{s}}{\text{hour}}
	         \times\dfrac{1}{1000}\frac{\text{km}}{\text{meter}} \\
	      &= 7.2\pi\si{\kilo\meter\per\hour} = \SI{22.62}{\kilo\meter\per\hour}
	\end{align}
\end{solution}
