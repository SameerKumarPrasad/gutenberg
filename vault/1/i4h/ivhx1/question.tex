\begin{solution}[\mcq]
   In one revolution of the wheel, the train moves forward a distance equal to the wheel's \textit{circumference}.
   And so, the train's speed - $S$ - is
   \begin{align}
      S &= \dfrac{3\times\pi\cdot 0.9\text{ meters}}{1\text{ second }}\times 3600\frac{\text{seconds}}{\text{hour}}
          \times\dfrac{1}{1000}\frac{\text{km}}{\text{meter}} \\
        &= 9.72\pi\frac{\text{km}}{\text{hour}} = 30.54\frac{\text{km}}{\text{hour}}
   \end{align}
\end{solution}
