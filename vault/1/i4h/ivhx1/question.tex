% Now, down to brasstacks. ** Writing good solutions is an Art **. 
% Eventually, you will find your own style. But here are some thoughts 
% to get you started: 
%
%   1. Write the solution as if you are writing it for your favorite
%      14-17 year old to help him/her understand. Could be your nephew, 
%      your niece, a cousin perhaps or probably even you when you 
%      were that age. Just write for them.
%
%   2. Use margin-notes to "talk" to students about the critical insights
%      in the question. The tone can be - in fact, should be - informal
%
%   3. Don't shy away from creating margin-figures you think will help
%      students understand. Yes, it is a little more work per question. 
%      But the question & solution will be written only once. Make that
%      attempt at writing a solution count.
%
%   4. At the same time, do not be too verbose. A long solution can
%      - at first sight - make the student think, "God, that is a lot to know".
%      Our aim is not to scare students. Rather, our aim should be to 
%      create many "Aha!" moments everyday in classrooms around the world
% 
%   5. Ensure that there are *no spelling mistakes anywhere*. We are an 
%      education company. Bad spellings suggest that we ourselves 
%      don't have any education. Also, use American spellings by default
% 
%   6. If a question has multiple parts, then first delete lines 40-41
%   7. If a question does not have parts, then first delete lines 43-69

\question[2] The wheel of a railway carriage is 90 cm in diameter and makes 3 revolutions 
in a second. How fast is the train going - in kilometers per hour?

\insertQR{QRC}

\begin{solution}[\mcq]
   In one revolution of the wheel, the train moves forward a distance equal to the wheel's \textit{circumference}.
   And so, the train's speed - $S$ - is
   \begin{align}
      S &= \dfrac{3\times\pi\cdot 0.9\text{ meters}}{1\text{ second }}\times 3600\frac{\text{seconds}}{\text{hour}}
          \times\dfrac{1}{1000}\frac{\text{km}}{\text{meter}} \\
        &= 9.72\pi\frac{\text{km}}{\text{hour}} = 30.54\frac{\text{km}}{\text{hour}}
   \end{align}
\end{solution}
