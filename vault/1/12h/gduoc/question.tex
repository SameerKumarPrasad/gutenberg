\question[2] A school offers two courses to its students - French and Computer Science. 
15\% of the students take both while 65\% take just the French class. What then is
the probability that a randomly picked student is taking Computer Science given
that she is already taking French?

\begin{solution}[\halfpage]
   If $P(F)$ be the probability that a students takes French and $P(C)$ the 
   probability that she takes Computer Science, then we are looking to find 
   $P(C \vert F)$, which we know is given by
   
   \begin{align}
      P(C \vert F) &= \dfrac{P(C \cap F)}{P(F)}
   \end{align}
   
   But the number of students taking French is made up of two kinds of students - 
   those taking just French and those studying both. Which means, 
   
   \begin{align}
       P(F) &= \dfrac{N_{\texttt{French-only}} + N_{\texttt{Both}}}{N_{\texttt{Total}}} \\ 
            &= \dfrac{N_{\texttt{French-only}}}{N_{\texttt{Total}}} + \dfrac{N_{\texttt{Both}}}{N_{\texttt{Total}}} \\
            &= 65\% + 15\% = 80\% = 0.8 \\
      \text{And therefore, } P(C\vert F) &= \dfrac{P(C \cap F)}{P(F)} = \dfrac{0.15}{0.8} = \dfrac{3}{16}
   \end{align}
\end{solution}
