\question[3] Suppose there are 2 bowls of cookies. Bowl A has 10 chocolate chip and 30 
	plain cookies while Bowl B has 20 of each. Fred picks a bowl at random 
	and from the picked bowl, a cookie at random. The cookie turns out to be 
	a plain one. What is the probability that Fred picked it out of Bowl A?

		   P(picks bowl $X$) & 0.5 & 0.5 \\
		   P(plain cookie $\vert X$) & $\frac{30}{40} = 0.75$ & $\frac{20}{40} = 0.5$ \\

\begin{solution}[\halfpage]
	If $P(A)$ and $P(B)$ be the probabilities that a cookie is picked from bowls A and B respectively,
	then the probability we need is, 
	
	\begin{align}
		P(A \vert plain) &= \dfrac{P(plain \vert A) \cdot P(A)}{P(plain)} \\
		  &= \dfrac{P(plain \vert A) \cdot P(A)}{P(plain \vert A)\cdot P(A) + P(plain \vert B)\cdot P(B)} \\
		  &= \dfrac{0.75 \times 0.5}{0.75\times 0.5 + 0.5\times 0.5} \\
		  &= 0.6
	\end{align}

\end{solution}
