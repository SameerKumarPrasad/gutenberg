  My friend Fred has two urns - A and B - each containing colored balls. Urn A
  has 30\% brown, 20\% yellow, 20\% red, 10\% green, 10\% orange and 10\% tan 
  colored balls. Urn B has 13\% brown, 14\% yellow, 13\% red, 20\% green,
  16\% orange and 20\% blue balls. 
  
  Fred draws one ball each from each of the urns. They turn out to be yellow and
  green. What is the probability that the yellow ball was from Urn A?

\begin{solution}[\fullpage]
   If $Y$ be the event that a yellow ball is drawn and $G$ the event that a green ball is 
   drawn, then the probability we seek is $P(Y_A \vert YG)$, where $YG$ is the event
   that a yellow and a green ball are drawn and $Y_A$ the event that the yellow ball is 
   drawn from Urn A
   
   \begin{align}
      P(Y_A \vert YG) &= \dfrac{P(YG \vert Y_A)\cdot P(Y_A)}{P(YG \vert Y_A)\cdot P(Y_A) + P(YG \vert Y_B)\cdot P(Y_B)}
   \end{align}
   
   Now, $P(YG \vert Y_A) = P(G_B)$. Why? Because the only way to get a green and a yellow ball 
   \textit{given that} the yellow ball is drawn from Urn A is to draw a green ball from Urn B.
   
   Similarly, $P(YG \vert Y_B) = P(G_A)$. And therefore, 
   
   \begin{align}
       P(Y_A \vert YG) &= \dfrac{P(G_B)\cdot P(Y_A)}{P(G_B)\cdot P(Y_A) + P(G_A)\cdot P(Y_B)} \\
                       &= \dfrac{0.2 \times 0.2}{0.2\times 0.2 + 0.1\times 0.14} \\
                       &= 0.741 = 74.1\%
   \end{align}
   That is an unexpectedly high probability. But it is what it is.
\end{solution}
