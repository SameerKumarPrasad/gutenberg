\begin{solution}[\halfpage]
	The first three terms would be $\dfrac{a_2}{r}$, $a_2$ and $a_2r$, where $a_2$ is the second term
	\begin{align}
		\dfrac{a_2}{r}\cdot a_2\cdot a_2r &= 27 \Rightarrow a_2^3 = 27 \Rightarrow a_2 = 3 \\
		\text{Also }, \dfrac{a_2}{r} + a_2 + a_2r &= 13 \Rightarrow r + \dfrac{1}{r} = \dfrac{13}{3} - 1 \\
		\Rightarrow 3r^2 - 10r + 3 &= 0 \text{ or } r = \frac{1}{3}, 3
	\end{align}
	
	With $r=\frac{1}{3}$, the sequence cannot be increasing - as is required. Hence, $r = 3$ is the only
	acceptable solution
	
	The sequence, therefore, is $\lbrace 1,3,9,27,81\ldots\rbrace$. And the sum of the first 
	5 terms is
	\begin{align}
		S_5 &= \dfrac{a_1\cdot(r^5 - 1)}{r-1} = \dfrac{1\cdot(3^5 - 1)}{2} = 121
	\end{align}
	
\end{solution}
