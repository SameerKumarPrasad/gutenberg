\question[3] There are an \textit{even} number of terms in a geometric progression. The sum 
of all terms of the progression is thrice as large as the sum of its odd terms. What is 
the common ratio of the progression?

\begin{solution}[\halfpage]
	If the number of terms - $n$ - is even, then $n = 2k$ for some $k$. Moreover, because
	there are an even number of terms, $\frac{n}{2} = k$ terms would be in odd positions
	and the remaining $k$ terms in even positions
	
	Now, if $s = \lbrace a, ar, ar^2, ar^3 \ldots \rbrace$ be the original sequence, then 
	the sequence of odd terms is $s_{\text{odd}} = \lbrace a, ar^2, ar^4 \ldots  \rbrace$. Notice
	that $s_{\text{odd}}$ has the same first term but a different common ratio - $r^2$. And so, if 
	
	\begin{align}
		%\dfrac{S}{S_{\text{odd}} &= \dfrac{\eSumOfGP{r}{n}}{\eSumOfGP{r}{n}}
		\dfrac{S}{S_{\text{odd}}} &= \dfrac{\eSumOfGP{r}{n}}
		{\dfrac{a\cdot(r^{2\cdot\frac{n}{2}} - 1)}{r^2-1}} = 3 \\
		\text{ then, } \dfrac{r^2 - 1}{r - 1} &= 3 \text{ or } r = 2
	\end{align}
\end{solution}
