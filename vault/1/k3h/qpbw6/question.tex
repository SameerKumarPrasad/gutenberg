\question If it takes 366 persons to be 100 percent sure that at least two in the group
have the same birthday, then how many would it take to be 50 percent sure? Assume a non-leap year

\begin{solution}
   If $B$ be the event that \textit{someone} in the group has the same birthday as me,
   $\overline{B}$ the event that \textit{no one} in the group has the same
   birthday as me and $N$ the number of people in the group (including me), then 
   \begin{align}
     P(B) = 1 - P(\overline{B}) &= 0.5 \\
     \Rightarrow P(B) = P(\overline{B}) &= 0.5 \\
     \text{where } P(\overline{B}) &= \left(\dfrac{364}{365}\right)^N \\
     \Rightarrow \left(\dfrac{364}{365}\right)^N &= 0.5 \\
     \text{or } N &= \dfrac{\log 0.5}{\log\left(\dfrac{364}{365}\right)} \\
       &= 253
   \end{align} 
\end{solution}
