\begin{solution}[\halfpage]
	If $N$ be the number of students, then each would get $\dfrac{300}{N}$ apples. 
	With 10 more students, each would get $\dfrac{300}{N+10}$ apples. And so if, 
	
	\begin{align}
		\dfrac{300}{N} - \dfrac{300}{N+10} &= 1 \\
		\text{then, } N^2 + 10N - 3000 &= 0 \\
		\Rightarrow N &= 50, -60
	\end{align}
	$N = -60$ does not make sense. And therefore $N=50$
\end{solution}
