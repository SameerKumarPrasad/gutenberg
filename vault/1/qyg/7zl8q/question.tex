\question[3]  A small aircraft encounters bad weather a third of the way
into a \SI{600}{\kilo\meter} flight. As a result, it has to slow down by
\SI{50}{\kilo\meter\per\hour} and it therefore lands 40 minutes later than usual. How
long does the aircraft take to fly the same route on a normal day?

\texttt{Hint: $1225 = 35^2$}

\begin{solution}[\fullpage]
	Let $S$ be the aircraft's speed in \si{km\per hour} and $T$ the time - in hours -
	the plane ordinarily takes for the 600 km trip
	
	Which means
	\begin{align}
		T &= \dfrac{\SI{600}{\kilo\meter}}{S}
	\end{align}
	
	On this day, however,
	\begin{align}
		T + \dfrac{40 \si{\minute}}{\SI{60}{\minute\per\hour}} &= \dfrac{200}{S} + \dfrac{400}{S-50}
	\end{align}
	
	Using (1) and (2), we get 
	\begin{align}
		\dfrac{600}{S} + \dfrac{2}{3} &= \dfrac{200}{S} + \dfrac{400}{S-50} \\
		\Rightarrow \dfrac{1800+2S}{3S} &= \dfrac{200S-10,000+400S}{S\cdot(S-50)} \\
		\Rightarrow (1800+2S)\cdot(S-50) &= (1800S - 30,000) \\
		\Rightarrow 2S^2-100S-60,000 &= 0 \\
		\Rightarrow S^2-50S-30,000 &= 0 \\
		\Rightarrow S &= \dfrac{50\pm\sqrt{50^2-4\times-30,000}}{2} \\
		              &= \dfrac{50\pm\sqrt{122500}}{2}
	\end{align}
	Speed can only be positive. And therefore
	\begin{align}
		S &= \dfrac{50+350}{2} = \SI{200}{\kilo\meter\per\hour}
	\end{align}
	Which means, that on a normal day, the aircraft will take 
	$\dfrac{\SI{600}{\kilo\meter}}{\SI{200}{\kilo\meter\per\hour}}$ = 3 hours
	
\end{solution}
