\question[3] There are three boxes: box X has 10 bulbs of which 4 are defective, 
box Y has 6 bulbs of which 1 is defective and box Z has 8 bulbs of which 3 are defective. 
A box is chosen at random and a bulb drawn from it. If the bulb is \textit{not} defective,
then what is the probability that it came from box Z?

      D = bulb is defective & X & Y & Z \\
      \midrule
      $P(D\,\vert\, box)$ & $\frac{4}{10}$ & $\frac{1}{6}$ & $\frac{3}{8}$ \\

\begin{solution}[\fullpage]
   The probability we are seeking is $\bayesp{Z}{\textoverline{D}}$, where $\overline{D}$ 
   is the event that a bulb is \textit{not} defective
   
   \begin{align}
      \bayesp{Z}{\textoverline{D}} &= \dfrac{\bayesf{\textoverline{D}}{Z}}
      {\bayesf{\textoverline{D}}{X} + \bayesf{\textoverline{D}}{Y} + \bayesf{\textoverline{D}}{Z}} \\
      &= \dfrac{\frac{5}{8}\cdot\frac{1}{3}}{\frac{1}{3}\cdot\left(\frac{5}{8} +
      \frac{3}{5} + \frac{5}{6}\right)} \\
      &= \dfrac{150}{494} = \dfrac{75}{247}
   \end{align}
   
\end{solution}
