\question[5] A cyclist covered a distance of 96 km two hours faster than he assumed. Every hour
he travelled 1 km more than he intended to in 1h 15min. What was his speed?

  	\begin{tabular}{cccc}
  	    \toprule
  		& Speed (km/h) & Number of 1-hour periods & Distance covered \\
  		\midrule
  		Normally & $s$ & $N$ & 96 \\
  		Now & $\frac{5}{4}s + 1$ & $N-2$ & 96 \\
  		\bottomrule

\begin{solution}[\fullpage]
	If $s$ be the cyclist's speed on any other day, then this time around he was 
	travelling at $\left(\dfrac{75\text{ min}}{60\text{ min}}s + 1\right) \text{km/hour} = \left(\dfrac{5}{4}s + 1\right)$.
	
	The second insight is that 
	
	\begin{align}
		s\cdot N &= \left( \dfrac{5}{4}s + 1 \right)\cdot (N-2) = 96\text{ km} \\
		\Rightarrow \dfrac{5}{4}sN - \dfrac{5}{2}s + N - 2 &= 96 \\
		\dfrac{5}{4}\cdot 96 - \dfrac{5}{2}s + \dfrac{96}{s} - 2 &= 96 \\
		\Rightarrow 5s^2 - 44s - 192 &= 0 \\
		\Rightarrow s &= \dfrac{44\pm\sqrt{44^2-4\cdot 5 \cdot (-192)}}{2\cdot 5} \\
		              &= 12,\, -3.2
	\end{align}
	Speed can only be positive and hence the cyclist's normal speed is $s = 12$ km per hour.
	And this time around, it was $\frac{5}{4}\cdot 12 + 1 = 16$ km per hour
\end{solution}
