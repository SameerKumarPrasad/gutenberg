\question[2] A box has 3 drawers; one contains 2 gold coins, one contains two silver coins
and one contains one gold and one silver coin. If a drawer is selected randomly 
and the one coin picked from it turns out to be gold, then what is the probability
that the coin was picked from the drawer with two gold coins?

    \begin{tabular}{cccc}
       \toprule
       Drawer & A & B & C \\
       \midrule
       N( gold coins ) & 2 & 0 & 1 \\
       $P(\text{gold coin} \vert \text{drawer})$ & 1 & 0 & 0.5 \\
       \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}
\fi 

\begin{solution}[\halfpage]
    The probability we are seeking is $P(A \vert G)$, where $G$ is the event of drawing
    a gold coin
    
    Now, 
    \begin{align}
       \bayesp{A}{G} &= \dfrac{\bayesf{G}{A}}{\bayesf{G}{A} + \bayesf{G}{B} + \bayesf{G}{C}} \\
          &= \dfrac{1\cdot\frac{1}{3}}{1\cdot\frac{1}{3} + 0\cdot\frac{1}{3} 
          + \frac{1}{2}\cdot\frac{1}{3}} \\
          &= \dfrac{2}{3}
    \end{align}
\end{solution}
