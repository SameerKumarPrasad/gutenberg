% Now, down to brasstacks. ** Writing good solutions is an Art **. 
% Eventually, you will find your own style. But here are some thoughts 
% to get you started: 
%
%   1. Write the solution as if you are writing it for your favorite
%      14-17 year old to help him/her understand. Could be your nephew, 
%      your niece, a cousin perhaps or probably even you when you 
%      were that age. Just write for them.
%
%   2. Use margin-notes to "talk" to students about the critical insights
%      in the question. The tone can be - in fact, should be - informal
%
%   3. Don't shy away from creating margin-figures you think will help
%      students understand. Yes, it is a little more work per question. 
%      But the question & solution will be written only once. Make that
%      attempt at writing a solution count.
%
%   4. At the same time, do not be too verbose. A long solution can
%      - at first sight - make the student think, "God, that is a lot to know".
%      Our aim is not to scare students. Rather, our aim should be to 
%      create many "Aha!" moments everyday in classrooms around the world
% 
%   5. Ensure that there are *no spelling mistakes anywhere*. We are an 
%      education company. Bad spellings suggest that we ourselves 
%      don't have any education. Also, use American spellings by default
% 
%   6. If a question has multiple parts, then first delete lines 40-41
%   7. If a question does not have parts, then first delete lines 43-69

\begin{solution}[\halfpage]
	If $S$ be the required sum, then
	\begin{align}
		S &= 1 + \frac{4}{5} + \frac{7}{5^2} + \frac{10}{5^3}\ldots = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\dfrac{3k+1}{5^k} \\
		\Rightarrow\dfrac{S}{5} &= \sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\dfrac{3k+1}{5^{k+1}} \\
		\Rightarrow \underbrace{S - \dfrac{S}{5}}_{= \frac{4S}{5}} &= \underbrace{1 + \sum_{m=1}^{\infty}\dfrac{3m+1}{5^m}}
		_{\text{first term}}- \sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\dfrac{3k+1}{5^{k+1}} \\
		&= 1 + \sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\dfrac{3(k+1)+1}{5^{k+1}}-\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\dfrac{3k+1}{5^{k+1}} \\
		&= 1 + \sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\dfrac{3}{5^{k+1}} \\
		&= 1 + 3\cdot\left( \dfrac{1}{5} + \dfrac{1}{5^2} + \dfrac{1}{5^3}\ldots \right) \\
		&= 1 + 3\cdot\dfrac{\frac{1}{5}}{1-\frac{1}{5}} = 1 + \dfrac{3}{4} = \dfrac{7}{4} \\
		\Rightarrow S &= \dfrac{5}{4}\cdot\dfrac{7}{4} = \dfrac{35}{16}
	\end{align}
\end{solution}
