% This is an empty shell file placed for you by the 'examiner' script.
% You can now fill in the TeX for your question here.

% Now, down to brasstacks. ** Writing good solutions is an Art **. 
% Eventually, you will find your own style. But here are some thoughts 
% to get you started: 
%
%   1. Write the solution as if you are writing it for your favorite
%      14-17 year old to help him/her understand. Could be your nephew, 
%      your niece, a cousin perhaps or probably even you when you 
%      were that age. Just write for them.
%
%   2. Use margin-notes to "talk" to students about the critical insights
%      in the question. The tone can be - in fact, should be - informal
%
%   3. Don't shy away from creating margin-figures you think will help
%      students understand. Yes, it is a little more work per question. 
%      But the question & solution will be written only once. Make that
%      attempt at writing a solution count.
%
%   4. At the same time, do not be too verbose. A long solution can
%      - at first sight - make the student think, "God, that is a lot to know".
%      Our aim is not to scare students. Rather, our aim should be to 
%      create many "Aha!" moments everyday in classrooms around the world
% 
%   5. Ensure that there are *no spelling mistakes anywhere*. We are an 
%      education company. Bad spellings suggest that we ourselves 
%      don't have any education. Also, use American spellings by default
% 
%   6. If a question has multiple parts, then first delete lines 40-41
%   7. If a question does not have parts, then first delete lines 43-69

\question Two pipes - $A$ and $B$ - when used together can fill a tank in 6 minutes.
Individually, however, pipe $A$ takes 5 minutes longer than pipe $B$ to fill the same
tank. Find the times then that each pipe takes individually

  % stuff to be shown only in the answer key - like explanatory margin figures
\fi 

\begin{solution}
	If $R_A$ and $R_B$ be the rates - expressed in unit volume/minute - at which the two
	operate individually and $T_A$ and $T_B$ the times they take to fill the tank, then
	where is what we know
	\begin{align}
		T_A &= \dfrac{V_{tank}}{R_A} \Rightarrow R_A = \dfrac{V_{tank}}{T_A}\\
		T_B &= \dfrac{V_{tank}}{R_B} \Rightarrow R_B = \dfrac{V_{tank}}{T_B}\\
		T_A &= T_B + 5\text{ minutes} \\
		6\text{ minutes} &= \dfrac{V_{tank}}{R_A + R_B} \\
		\Rightarrow 6 &= \dfrac{V_{tank}}{V_{tank}\cdot\left(\dfrac{1}{T_B + 5} + \dfrac{1}{T_B}\right)} \\
		\Rightarrow T_B^2 - 7T_B - 30 &= 0 \\
		\Rightarrow T_B &= -3, 10
	\end{align}
	
	Ignoring $T_B = -3$, we get $T_B = 10\text{ minutes}$ and $T_A = T_B + 5 = 15\text{ minutes}$
\end{solution}
