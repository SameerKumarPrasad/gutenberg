% Now, down to brasstacks. ** Writing good solutions is an Art **. 
% Eventually, you will find your own style. But here are some thoughts 
% to get you started: 
%
%   1. Write to be understood - but be crisp. Your own solution should not take 
%      more space than you will give to the student. Hence, if you take more than 
%      a half-page to write a solution, then give the student a full-page and so on...
%
%   2. Use margin-notes to "talk" to students about the critical insights
%      in the question. The tone can be - in fact, should be - informal
%
%   3. Don't shy away from creating margin-figures you think will help
%      students understand. Yes, it is a little more work per question. 
%      But the question & solution will be written only once. Make that
%      attempt at writing a solution count.
%      
%      3b. Use bc_to_fig.tex. Its an easier way to generate plots & graphs 
% 
%   4. Ensure that there are *no spelling mistakes anywhere*. We are an 
%      education company. Bad spellings suggest that we ourselves 
%      don't have any education. Also, use American spellings by default
% 
%   5. If a question has multiple parts, then first delete lines 40-41
%   6. If a question does not have parts, then first delete lines 43-69
%   
%   7. Create versions of the question when possible. Use commands defined in 
%      tufte-tweaks.sty to do so. Its easier than you think

\question A zoo sponsored a special one day contest to name a new baby elephant.
Zoo visitors deposited entries in a special box between noon $(t=0)$ and $8$ P.M.
$(t=8)$. The number of entries in the box $t$ hours after noon is modeled a
differentiable function $E(t)$ for $0 \leq t \leq 8$. Value of $E(t)$, in hundreds
of entries at various times are shown in the table below.\\
\textit{Use of calculator is permitted for this questions}
\begin{table}
  \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
    \hline
    $t$(hours) &0 &2 &5 &7 &8 \\ \hline
    $E(t)$(hundreds of entries) &0 &4 &13 &21 &23 \\

\begin{parts}
  \part Use the data in the table to approximate the rate, in hundreds of entries 
  per hour, at which entries were being deposited at $t=6$. Show the computation
  that lead to your answer.  
  \begin{solution}
    We can approximate the rate $R$ at $t=6$ using the data provided as follows:
    \begin{align}
      R = \dfrac{E(7)-E(5)}{7-5} = \dfrac{8}{2} = 4 \nonumber
    \end{align}
  \end{solution}

  \part Use a trapezoidal sum with the four subintervals given by the table to
  approximate the value of $\dfrac{1}{8}\int_0^8 E(t)\ud t$. Using the correct
  units explain the meaning $\dfrac{1}{8}\int_0^8 E(t)\ud t$ in terms of the 
  number of entries.
  \begin{solution}
    \begin{align}
      \dfrac{1}{8}\int_0^8 E(t)\ud t &= \dfrac{1}{8}\left( 
        2\dfrac{E(0)+E(2)}{2}+3\dfrac{E(2)+E(5)}{2}+
        2\dfrac{E(5)+E(7)}{2}+\dfrac{E(7)+E(8)}{2}\right) \nonumber \\
        &= 10.687 \nonumber
    \end{align}
    $\dfrac{1}{8}\int_0^8 E(t)\ud t$ gives the average number of hundreds of entries 
    in the box between noon and $8$ P.M.
  \end{solution}

  \part At $8$ P.M., volunteers began to process the entries. They processed the 
  entries at a rate modeled by the function $P$. Where $P(t) = t^3 - 30t^2 + 298t - 976$
  hundreds of entries per hour for $8 \leq t \leq 12$. According to the model, how many 
  entries had not yet been processed by midnight $(t=23)$?
  \begin{solution}
    Let $T$ be the total number of entries processed. Then,
    \begin{align}
      T &= \int_8^{12} P(t) \ud t \nonumber \\
        &= \int_8^{12} t^3 - 30t^2 + 298t - 976 \nonumber \\
        &= \left[\dfrac{t^4}{4} - 30\dfrac{t^3}{3} + 298\dfrac{t^2}{2} - 976t \right]_8^{12} \nonumber \\
        &= 16 \nonumber
    \end{align}
    The number of hundreds of entries yet to be processed is $23-16=7$
  \end{solution}

  \part According to the model from part(c), at what time were the entries being processed
  the most quickly. Justify your answer.
  \begin{solution}
    To calculate this, we first need to find the extrema (maxima/minima) points of the functon
    and then calculate its value at each of them and the domain extremes $0, 8$.
    \begin{align}
      P'(t) = 3t^2 - 60t + 298 \nonumber
    \end{align}
    $P'(t) = 0$ at $t=9.183503$ and $t=10.816497$. Therefore candidate values for $P_{max}$ are
    {$0$, $5.088662$, $2.911338$ and $8$}. Entries are being processed most quickly at time $t=12$
    at the rate $8$ hundred entries per hour.
  \end{solution}
