% Now, down to brasstacks. ** Writing good solutions is an Art **. 
% Eventually, you will find your own style. But here are some thoughts 
% to get you started: 
%
%   1. Write the solution as if you are writing it for your favorite
%      14-17 year old to help him/her understand. Could be your nephew, 
%      your niece, a cousin perhaps or probably even you when you 
%      were that age. Just write for them.
%
%   2. Use margin-notes to "talk" to students about the critical insights
%      in the question. The tone can be - in fact, should be - informal
%
%   3. Don't shy away from creating margin-figures you think will help
%      students understand. Yes, it is a little more work per question. 
%      But the question & solution will be written only once. Make that
%      attempt at writing a solution count.
%
%   4. At the same time, do not be too verbose. A long solution can
%      - at first sight - make the student think, "God, that is a lot to know".
%      Our aim is not to scare students. Rather, our aim should be to 
%      create many "Aha!" moments everyday in classrooms around the world
% 
%   5. Ensure that there are *no spelling mistakes anywhere*. We are an 
%      education company. Bad spellings suggest that we ourselves 
%      don't have any education. And, use American spellings

\question[2]  Vidya received \texteuro2,000 from her grandparents when she graduated from
\insertQR{QRC}
school and entered college. She placed the money in an account that earns
her 12\% interest(annual) compounded semi-annually. How much will Vidya have when she 
graduates in 4 years time?

  % stuff to be shown only in the answer key - like explanatory margin figures
  \marginnote[1cm]{
    \begin{align}
      A &= \text{\texteuro 2,000}\cdot (1.06)^8 \\
      \Rightarrow \log A &= \log 2,000 + 8\cdot\log 1.06 \\
                         &= 3.50347 \\
      \Rightarrow A &= \text{\texteuro 3,187.7}
    \end{align}
  }
\fi 

\begin{solution}[\mcq]
  If $A$ be the amount Vidya has after $4$ years, then
	\begin{align}
			 \text{A} &= \text{\texteuro 2,000}\cdot\left(1 + \dfrac{0.12}{2}\right)^{2\times 4} \\
			          &= \text{\texteuro 2,000}\cdot 1.06^8 \\
                &= \text{\texteuro 3,187.7}
  \end{align}
\end{solution}
