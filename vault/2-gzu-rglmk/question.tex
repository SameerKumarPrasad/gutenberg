% This is an empty shell file placed for you by the 'examiner' script.

% Now, down to brasstacks. ** Writing good solutions is an Art **. 
% Eventually, you will find your own style. But here are some thoughts 
% to get you started: 
%
%   1. Write the solution as if you are writing it for your favorite
%      14-17 year old to help him/her understand. Could be your nephew, 
%      your niece, a cousin perhaps or probably even you when you 
%      were that age. Just write for them.
%
%   2. Use margin-notes to "talk" to students about the critical insights
%      in the question. The tone can be - in fact, should be - informal
%
%   3. Don't shy away from creating margin-figures you think will help
%      students understand. Yes, it is a little more work per question. 
%      But the question & solution will be written only once. Make that
%      attempt at writing a solution count.
%
%   4. At the same time, do not be too verbose. A long solution can
%      - at first sight - make the student think, "God, that is a lot to know".
%      Our aim is not to scare students. Rather, our aim should be to 
%      create many "Aha!" moments everyday in classrooms around the world
% 
%   5. Ensure that there are *no spelling mistakes anywhere*. We are an 
%      education company. Bad spellings suggest that we ourselves 
%      don't have any education. And, use American spellings

\question[3] Vidya received Rs.75,000 from her grandparents on passing her high school examinations. She decided to place into an account that earns 8.5\% semi-annually while she went to college. How much will Vidya's account have at the end of four years.

  % stuff to be shown only in the answer key - like explanatory margin figures
\fi 

\begin{solution}[\halfpage]
	\begin{align}
			 \text{A} &= 75000\left(1 + \dfrac{8.5}{100}\right)^8 \\
			 \text{A} &= 75000\left(\dfrac{108.5}{100}\right)^8 \\			
		\log \text{A} &= \log 75000 + 8\left(\log 108.5 - 2\right) \\
			 \text{A} &= 144012.4	
	\end{align}
	Vidya's account shall have Rs.1,44,012.40 at the end of four years of college.
\end{solution}
