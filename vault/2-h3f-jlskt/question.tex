% This is an empty shell file placed for you by the 'examiner' script.
% You can now fill in the TeX for your question here.

% Now, down to brasstacks. ** Writing good solutions is an Art **. 
% Eventually, you will find your own style. But here are some thoughts 
% to get you started: 
%
%   1. Write the solution as if you are writing it for your favorite
%      14-17 year old to help him/her understand. Could be your nephew, 
%      your niece, a cousin perhaps or probably even you when you 
%      were that age. Just write for them.
%
%   2. Use margin-notes to "talk" to students about the critical insights
%      in the question. The tone can be - in fact, should be - informal
%
%   3. Don't shy away from creating margin-figures you think will help
%      students understand. Yes, it is a little more work per question. 
%      But the question & solution will be written only once. Make that
%      attempt at writing a solution count.
%
%   4. At the same time, do not be too verbose. A long solution can
%      - at first sight - make the student think, "God, that is a lot to know".
%      Our aim is not to scare students. Rather, our aim should be to 
%      create many "Aha!" moments everyday in classrooms around the world
% 
%   5. Ensure that there are *no spelling mistakes anywhere*. We are an 
%      education company. Bad spellings suggest that we ourselves 
%      don't have any education. Also, use American spellings by default
% 
%   6. If a question has multiple parts, then first delete lines 40-41
%   7. If a question does not have parts, then first delete lines 43-69

\question Find four numbers between 4 and 40 such that an arithmetic progression results.

\insertQR{}

\ifprintanswers
  % stuff to be shown only in the answer key - like explanatory margin figures
\fi 

\begin{solution}
  We need to form a series such that the first term is 4 and the sixth term is 40. Applying the forumla for the $n_{th}$ term of an arithmetic progression $a_n = a + (n-1)d$ where $a$ is the first term and $d$ is the common differnce we get,
  \begin{align}
    a_6 &= 4 + (6-1)d \\
    40  &= 4 + 5d \\
    d   &= 7.2
  \end{align}  
  The sequence is 4, 11.2, 18.4, 25.6, 32.8, 40.

\end{solution}
