% This is an empty shell file placed for you by the 'examiner' script.
% You can now fill in the TeX for your question here.

% Now, down to brasstacks. ** Writing good solutions is an Art **. 
% Eventually, you will find your own style. But here are some thoughts 
% to get you started: 
%
%   1. Write the solution as if you are writing it for your favorite
%      14-17 year old to help him/her understand. Could be your nephew, 
%      your niece, a cousin perhaps or probably even you when you 
%      were that age. Just write for them.
%
%   2. Use margin-notes to "talk" to students about the critical insights
%      in the question. The tone can be - in fact, should be - informal
%
%   3. Don't shy away from creating margin-figures you think will help
%      students understand. Yes, it is a little more work per question. 
%      But the question & solution will be written only once. Make that
%      attempt at writing a solution count.
%
%   4. At the same time, do not be too verbose. A long solution can
%      - at first sight - make the student think, "God, that is a lot to know".
%      Our aim is not to scare students. Rather, our aim should be to 
%      create many "Aha!" moments everyday in classrooms around the world
% 
%   5. Ensure that there are *no spelling mistakes anywhere*. We are an 
%      education company. Bad spellings suggest that we ourselves 
%      don't have any education. Also, use American spellings by default
% 
%   6. If a question has multiple parts, then first delete lines 40-41
%   7. If a question does not have parts, then first delete lines 43-69

\begin{solution}[\halfpage]
  Given $a_1 = 4$ and $a_6 = 40$, we need to find $a_2$, $a_3$, $a_4$ and $a_5$. Now,
  \begin{align}
     a_6 &= a_1 + (6-1)\cdot d \\
     \text{or } 40 &= 4 + 5d \Rightarrow d = 7.2
  \end{align}
  And therefore, 
  \begin{align}
     a_2 &= 4 + 7.2 = 11.2 \\
     a_3 &= 4 + (3-1)\cdot 7.2 = 18.4 \\
     a_4 &= 4 + (4-1)\cdot 7.2 = 25.6 \\
     a_5 &= 4 + (5-1)\cdot 7.2 = 32.8
  \end{align}

\end{solution}
