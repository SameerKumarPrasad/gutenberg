% Now, down to brasstacks. ** Writing good solutions is an Art **. 
% Eventually, you will find your own style. But here are some thoughts 
% to get you started: 
%
%   1. Write the solution as if you are writing it for your favorite
%      14-17 year old to help him/her understand. Could be your nephew, 
%      your niece, a cousin perhaps or probably even you when you 
%      were that age. Just write for them.
%
%   2. Use margin-notes to "talk" to students about the critical insights
%      in the question. The tone can be - in fact, should be - informal
%
%   3. Don't shy away from creating margin-figures you think will help
%      students understand. Yes, it is a little more work per question. 
%      But the question & solution will be written only once. Make that
%      attempt at writing a solution count.
%
%   4. At the same time, do not be too verbose. A long solution can
%      - at first sight - make the student think, "God, that is a lot to know".
%      Our aim is not to scare students. Rather, our aim should be to 
%      create many "Aha!" moments everyday in classrooms around the world
% 
%   5. Ensure that there are *no spelling mistakes anywhere*. We are an 
%      education company. Bad spellings suggest that we ourselves 
%      don't have any education. Also, use American spellings by default
% 
%   6. If a question has multiple parts, then first delete lines 40-41
%   7. If a question does not have parts, then first delete lines 43-69

\question The sum of the three terms of a geometric progression is $35$ whereas the sum of the squares of its terms is $525$. Find the terms?

\begin{solution}
  Let the terms of the series of $\dfrac{a}{r}$, $a$ and $ar$. Based on the conditions specified in the question we can construct the following equations,
  \begin{align}
    \dfrac{a}{r} + a + ar           &= 35 \\
    (\dfrac{a}{r})^2 + a^2 + (ar)^2 &= 525
  \end{align}
  We can re-write equation (2) from above as follows,
  \begin{align}
    a^2(\dfrac{1}{r^2} + 1 + r^2)                            &= 525 \\
    a^2((\dfrac{1}{r} + 1 + r)^2 - 2(\dfrac{1}{r} + 1 + r))  &= 525 \\
    (a(\dfrac{1}{r} + 1 + r))^2 - 2a^2(\dfrac{1}{r} + 1 + r) &= 525
  \end{align}  
  Using the result from equation (1) in equation (5),
  \begin{align}
    35^2 - 2a(35) &= 525 \\
    a             &= 10
  \end{align}
  Replacing this result in equation (1), we get the common ratio as $2$ (or $\dfrac{1}{2}$) and the terms of the series as $5$, $10$ and $20$.
