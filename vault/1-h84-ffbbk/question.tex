% Now, down to brasstacks. ** Writing good solutions is an Art **. 
% Eventually, you will find your own style. But here are some thoughts 
% to get you started: 
%
%   1. Write to be understood - but be crisp. Your own solution should not take 
%      more space than you will give to the student. Hence, if you take more than 
%      a half-page to write a solution, then give the student a full-page and so on...
%
%   2. Use margin-notes to "talk" to students about the critical insights
%      in the question. The tone can be - in fact, should be - informal
%
%   3. Don't shy away from creating margin-figures you think will help
%      students understand. Yes, it is a little more work per question. 
%      But the question & solution will be written only once. Make that
%      attempt at writing a solution count.
%      
%      3b. Use bc_to_fig.tex. Its an easier way to generate plots & graphs 
% 
%   4. Ensure that there are *no spelling mistakes anywhere*. We are an 
%      education company. Bad spellings suggest that we ourselves 
%      don't have any education. Also, use American spellings by default
% 
%   5. If a question has multiple parts, then first delete lines 40-41
%   6. If a question does not have parts, then first delete lines 43-69
%   
%   7. Create versions of the question when possible. Use commands defined in 
%      tufte-tweaks.sty to do so. Its easier than you think

\question[4] Find the equation of the straight line that passes through the point of intersection of 
$\vbone x + \vbtwo y + \vbthree = 0$ and $\vbfour x + \vbseven y + \vbfive = 0$ \textit{and} is 
perpendicular to the line $3x-5y+11 = 0$

\begin{solution}[\halfpage]
	First, we must find that point of intersection. The two lines will intersect at an $x$ where
	\begin{align}
	    \vbone x + \vbtwo y + \vbthree &= 0 \text{ or } \vbtwo y = -(\vbone x + \vbthree) \\
	    \vbfour x + \vbseven y + \vbfive &= 0 \text { or } \vbseven y = -(\vbfour x + \vbfive) \\
	    \Rightarrow \dfrac{\vbone x + \vbthree}{\vbfour x + \vbfive} &= \vbsix \text{ or } x = \vbeight \\
	    \text{ which means that } y &= \dfrac{-(\vbthree + \vbone\cdot\vbeight)}{\vbtwo} = \vbnine
	\end{align}
	So, the point of intersection is at $(\vbeight, \vbnine)$
	
	Now, the slope of the line \textit{ perpendicular } to 
	$3x - 5y + 11 = 0 \Rightarrow y = \dfrac{3}{5}x + \dfrac{11}{5}$ is $-\dfrac{5}{3}$. And so, its equation
	would be 
	
	\gcalcexpr[2]{\vbten}{5*\vbeight + 3*\vbnine}
	
	\begin{align}
		\dfrac{y - \vbnine}{x - \vbeight} &= -\dfrac{5}{3} \\
		\Rightarrow 3y - 3\times\vbnine &= -5x + 5\times\vbeight \\
		\text{ or } 3y + 5x + \vbten &= 0
	\end{align}
	
\end{solution}
