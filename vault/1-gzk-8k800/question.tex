% Now, down to brasstacks. ** Writing good solutions is an Art **. 
% Eventually, you will find your own style. But here are some thoughts 
% to get you started: 
%
%   1. Write the solution as if you are writing it for your favorite
%      14-17 year old to help him/her understand. Could be your nephew, 
%      your niece, a cousin perhaps or probably even you when you 
%      were that age. Just write for them.
%
%   2. Use margin-notes to "talk" to students about the critical insights
%      in the question. The tone can be - in fact, should be - informal
%
%   3. Don't shy away from creating margin-figures you think will help
%      students understand. Yes, it is a little more work per question. 
%      But the question & solution will be written only once. Make that
%      attempt at writing a solution count.
%
%   4. At the same time, do not be too verbose. A long solution can
%      - at first sight - make the student think, "God, that is a lot to know".
%      Our aim is not to scare students. Rather, our aim should be to 
%      create many "Aha!" moments everyday in classrooms around the world
% 
%   5. Ensure that there are *no spelling mistakes anywhere*. We are an 
%      education company. Bad spellings suggest that we ourselves 
%      don't have any education. And, use American spellings

\question[3]   A bank is offering two investment schemes. The first scheme offers
\insertQR{QRC}
7\% compound interest in the first year and - in each subsequent year - 25\% less 
than what was offered in the previous year. The second scheme offers a constant 5.75\%
throughout. If you are investing for a 2-year period, which scheme would you choose?

\fi 

\begin{solution}[\halfpage]
	The amount in-hand at the end of 2 years with the first scheme is
	\begin{align}
		P_1 &= P_0\cdot\underbrace{\left( 1 + \dfrac{7}{100}\right)}_{\texttt{first year}}
		\cdot\underbrace{\left( 1 + \dfrac{5.25}{100}\right)}_{\texttt{second year}} \\
		&= 1.126\cdot P_0
	\end{align}
	
	Similarly, with the second scheme, you would get
	\begin{align}
		P_2 &= P_0\cdot\left( 1 + \dfrac{5.75}{100}\right)^{2} \\
		    &= 1.118\cdot P_0
	\end{align}
	
	Clearly, you would be better off going with the first scheme
\end{solution}
