    <tex correct='true'>
          f(x) = x^{1}\text{ is continuous at x=1}\\
          f(x) = x^{1001}\text{ is continuous at x=1001}\\

    <context>\text{Is the following analysis correct?}</context>
    <tex correct='true'>\begin{align}
    \lim_{x\to n}f(x) &amp;= \lim_{x\to n} (x^n)  = n^n\\
  
\end{align}\\
  f(n) = (n)^n = n^n\\	
\therefore\text{the function f(x) is continuous at x=n.}</tex>
    <tex></tex>
    <reason>\text{Since, the function f(x) is not changing \\
at x=n, for the function to be continuous at \\
x=n, the limit at x should be equal to the\\
value of function at x=n}</reason>
