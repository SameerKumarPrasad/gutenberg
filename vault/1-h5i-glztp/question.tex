% This is an empty shell file placed for you by the 'examiner' script.
% You can now fill in the TeX for your question here.

% Now, down to brasstacks. ** Writing good solutions is an Art **. 
% Eventually, you will find your own style. But here are some thoughts 
% to get you started: 
%
%   1. Write the solution as if you are writing it for your favorite
%      14-17 year old to help him/her understand. Could be your nephew, 
%      your niece, a cousin perhaps or probably even you when you 
%      were that age. Just write for them.
%
%   2. Use margin-notes to "talk" to students about the critical insights
%      in the question. The tone can be - in fact, should be - informal
%
%   3. Don't shy away from creating margin-figures you think will help
%      students understand. Yes, it is a little more work per question. 
%      But the question & solution will be written only once. Make that
%      attempt at writing a solution count.
%
%   4. At the same time, do not be too verbose. A long solution can
%      - at first sight - make the student think, "God, that is a lot to know".
%      Our aim is not to scare students. Rather, our aim should be to 
%      create many "Aha!" moments everyday in classrooms around the world
% 
%   5. Ensure that there are *no spelling mistakes anywhere*. We are an 
%      education company. Bad spellings suggest that we ourselves 
%      don't have any education. Also, use American spellings by default
% 
%   6. If a question has multiple parts, then first delete lines 40-41
%   7. If a question does not have parts, then first delete lines 43-69

\begin{solution}[\halfpage]
	\begin{fullwidth}
    \begin{align}
       \sin\ang{20}\cdot\sin\ang{40}&\cdot\sin\ang{60}\cdot\sin\ang{80} = 
       \dfrac{1}{4}\times\overbrace{(4\cdot\sin\ang{20}\cdot\sin\ang{40}\cdot\sin\ang{80})}
       ^{\sin 3\theta = 4\sin\theta\cdot\sin\left( \frac{\pi}{3} - \theta\right)\cdot\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{3} +
        \theta\right)}\cdot\sin\ang{60} \\
       &= \dfrac{1}{4}\cdot\sin\ang{60}\cdot\sin\ang{60} \\
       &= \dfrac{1}{4}\cdot\left(\dfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \right)^2 = \dfrac{3}{16}
    \end{align}
    
    Alternatively, you can use the fact that $\fProdOfSin{a}{b}$ to re-write the above expression as
    \begin{align}
    	&\dfrac{\sin\ang{60}}{2}\cdot\left[ \eProdOfSin{\ang{20}}{\ang{80}}\right]\cdot\sin\ang{40} \\
    	&= \dfrac{\sqrt{3}}{4}\cdot\left[ \cos\ang{60}\sin\ang{40} - \cos\ang{100}\sin\ang{40}\right] \\
    	&= \dfrac{\sqrt{3}}{4\times 2}\cdot\left[ \underbrace{\eProdCosSin{\ang{60}}{\ang{40}}}_{2\cos{\ang{60}}\sin{\ang{40}}} - 
       \left\lbrace\underbrace{\eProdCosSin{\ang{100}}{\ang{40}}}_{2\cos{\ang{100}}\sin{\ang{40}}}\right\rbrace\right] \\
    	&= \dfrac{\sqrt{3}}{8}\cdot\left[ \sin\ang{100}-\sin\ang{20}-\sin\ang{140} + \sin\ang{60} \right] \\
    	&= \dfrac{\sqrt{3}}{8}\cdot\left[ \eDiffOfSin{\ang{100}}{\ang{140}} - \sin\ang{20} + \dfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \right]\\
    	&= \dfrac{\sqrt{3}}{8}\cdot\left[ -\sin\ang{20}\cdot(2\cos{(\ang{90} + \ang{30})} + 1) 
    	+ \dfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \right] \\
    	&= \dfrac{\sqrt{3}}{8}\cdot\left[ -\sin\ang{20}\cdot\underbrace{(-2\sin\ang{30} + 1)}_{ = 0 } 
    	+ \dfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \right] \\
    	&= \dfrac{3}{16}
    \end{align}
    \end{fullwidth}
