% Now, down to brasstacks. ** Writing good solutions is an Art **. 
% Eventually, you will find your own style. But here are some thoughts 
% to get you started: 
%
%   1. Write the solution as if you are writing it for your favorite
%      14-17 year old to help him/her understand. Could be your nephew, 
%      your niece, a cousin perhaps or probably even you when you 
%      were that age. Just write for them.
%
%   2. Use margin-notes to "talk" to students about the critical insights
%      in the question. The tone can be - in fact, should be - informal
%
%   3. Don't shy away from creating margin-figures you think will help
%      students understand. Yes, it is a little more work per question. 
%      But the question & solution will be written only once. Make that
%      attempt at writing a solution count.
%
%   4. At the same time, do not be too verbose. A long solution can
%      - at first sight - make the student think, "God, that is a lot to know".
%      Our aim is not to scare students. Rather, our aim should be to 
%      create many "Aha!" moments everyday in classrooms around the world
% 
%   5. Ensure that there are *no spelling mistakes anywhere*. We are an 
%      education company. Bad spellings suggest that we ourselves 
%      don't have any education. Also, use American spellings by default
% 
%   6. If a question has multiple parts, then first delete lines 40-41
%   7. If a question does not have parts, then first delete lines 43-69

\question[3] The ratio of sums of the first $m$ and $n$ terms of an A.P. is $\dfrac{m^2}{n^2}$.
Prove that the ratio of the $m^{th}$ and $n^{th}$ terms is $\dfrac{2m-1}{2n-1}$

\begin{solution}[\halfpage]
	\begin{align}
		\dfrac{S_m}{S_n} &= \dfrac{\eSumOfAP{m}}{\eSumOfAP{n}} = \dfrac{m^2}{n^2} \\
		\Rightarrow mn^2\cdot(2a + (m-1)d) &= m^2n\cdot(2a + (n-1)d) \\
		2amn^2 + m^2n^2d - mn^2d &= 2am^2n + m^2n^2d - m^2nd \\
		\Rightarrow 2amn\cdot(n-m) &= mnd\cdot(n-m) \\
		\Rightarrow 2a &= d 
	\end{align}
	Now, if $T_m$ and $T_n$ be the $m^{th}$ and $n^{th}$ terms respectively, then 
	\begin{align}
		\dfrac{T_m}{T_n} &= \dfrac{\eTermOfAP{m}}{\eTermOfAP{n}} \\
		&= \dfrac{a\cdot(1 + (m-1)\cdot 2)}{a\cdot(1 + (n-1)\cdot 2)} \\
		&= \dfrac{2m-1}{2n-1}
	\end{align}
\end{solution}
