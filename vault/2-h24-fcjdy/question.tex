% This is an empty shell file placed for you by the 'examiner' script.
% You can now fill in the TeX for your question here.

% Now, down to brasstacks. ** Writing good solutions is an Art **. 
% Eventually, you will find your own style. But here are some thoughts 
% to get you started: 
%
%   1. Write the solution as if you are writing it for your favorite
%      14-17 year old to help him/her understand. Could be your nephew, 
%      your niece, a cousin perhaps or probably even you when you 
%      were that age. Just write for them.
%
%   2. Use margin-notes to "talk" to students about the critical insights
%      in the question. The tone can be - in fact, should be - informal
%
%   3. Don't shy away from creating margin-figures you think will help
%      students understand. Yes, it is a little more work per question. 
%      But the question & solution will be written only once. Make that
%      attempt at writing a solution count.
%
%   4. At the same time, do not be too verbose. A long solution can
%      - at first sight - make the student think, "God, that is a lot to know".
%      Our aim is not to scare students. Rather, our aim should be to 
%      create many "Aha!" moments everyday in classrooms around the world
% 
%   5. Ensure that there are *no spelling mistakes anywhere*. We are an 
%      education company. Bad spellings suggest that we ourselves 
%      don't have any education. Also, use American spellings by default
% 
%   6. If a question has multiple parts, then first delete lines 40-41
%   7. If a question does not have parts, then first delete lines 43-69

\begin{solution}
  Let us call progression $17, 21, ...$ as A and $16, 21, ...$ as B. Since progression A increases in multiples of 4 and progression B increases by multiples of 5, the next term  they have in common will have a difference of 20 with the previous term, since the lowest common multiple of 4 and 5 is 20. Therefore the series of common terms would go something like $21, 41, 61$ and so on. \\
  To summarize the first ten terms of this series we use the standard summation formula  
  \begin{align}
    S_{n}   &= \dfrac{n}{2}(2(a) + (n-1)d) \\
    S_{10} &= \dfrac{10}{2}(2(21) + (10-1)20) \\
    S_{10} &= 5(42+180) \\
    S_{10} &= 1110
  \end{align}
