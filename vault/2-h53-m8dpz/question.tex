% This is an empty shell file placed for you by the 'examiner' script.
% You can now fill in the TeX for your question here.

% Now, down to brasstacks. ** Writing good solutions is an Art **. 
% Eventually, you will find your own style. But here are some thoughts 
% to get you started: 
%
%   1. Write to be understood - but be crisp. Your own solution should not take 
%      more space than you will give to the student. Hence, if you take more than 
%      a half-page to write a solution, then give the student a full-page and so on...
%
%   2. Use margin-notes to "talk" to students about the critical insights
%      in the question. The tone can be - in fact, should be - informal
%
%   3. Don't shy away from creating margin-figures you think will help
%      students understand. Yes, it is a little more work per question. 
%      But the question & solution will be written only once. Make that
%      attempt at writing a solution count.
%      
%      3b. Use bc_to_fig.tex. Its an easier way to generate plots & graphs 
% 
%   4. Ensure that there are *no spelling mistakes anywhere*. We are an 
%      education company. Bad spellings suggest that we ourselves 
%      don't have any education. Also, use American spellings by default
% 
%   5. If a question has multiple parts, then first delete lines 40-41
%   6. If a question does not have parts, then first delete lines 43-69
%   
%   7. Create versions of the question when possible. Use commands defined in 
%      tufte-tweaks.sty to do so. Its easier than you think

\question The straight line $bx-ay = ab$ passes through the intersection of the lines $\vbone x \vbtwo y =\vbthree$ and $\vbfour x\vbfive y =\vbsix$ 
and is parallel to the line $y=x-6$. Find $a$ and $b$.

\fi 


\begin{solution}
  Slope of line equals $1$, therefore
  \begin{align}
               ay &= bx-ab 				\nonumber \\
  	\Rightarrow y &= \dfrac{b}{a}x - 1  \nonumber \\
  	\Rightarrow b &= a
  \end{align}
  Intersection point through which the line passes is,
  \begin{align}  
    2(3-y) - 3y   &= 1 \nonumber \\    			
    \Rightarrow y &= 1\text{, }x = 2 
  \end{align}
  Using (1) and (2) we get,
  \begin{align}
    a2-a1=a^2 \nonumber \\
    a=b=1 \nonumber
  \end{align}
\end{solution}
