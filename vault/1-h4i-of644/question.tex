% Now, down to brasstacks. ** Writing good solutions is an Art **. 
% Eventually, you will find your own style. But here are some thoughts 
% to get you started: 
%
%   1. Write the solution as if you are writing it for your favorite
%      14-17 year old to help him/her understand. Could be your nephew, 
%      your niece, a cousin perhaps or probably even you when you 
%      were that age. Just write for them.
%
%   2. Use margin-notes to "talk" to students about the critical insights
%      in the question. The tone can be - in fact, should be - informal
%
%   3. Don't shy away from creating margin-figures you think will help
%      students understand. Yes, it is a little more work per question. 
%      But the question & solution will be written only once. Make that
%      attempt at writing a solution count.
%
%   4. At the same time, do not be too verbose. A long solution can
%      - at first sight - make the student think, "God, that is a lot to know".
%      Our aim is not to scare students. Rather, our aim should be to 
%      create many "Aha!" moments everyday in classrooms around the world
% 
%   5. Ensure that there are *no spelling mistakes anywhere*. We are an 
%      education company. Bad spellings suggest that we ourselves 
%      don't have any education. Also, use American spellings by default
% 
%   6. If a question has multiple parts, then first delete lines 40-41
%   7. If a question does not have parts, then first delete lines 43-69

     \begin{align}
        2\cos\dfrac{\pi}{13}\cos\dfrac{9\pi}{13} &+ \overbrace{\cos\dfrac{3\pi}{13} + \cos\dfrac{5\pi}{13}}^{\cos A + \cos B}
        = 2\cos\dfrac{\pi}{13}\cos\dfrac{9\pi}{13} + 
        2\cos\dfrac{3\pi + 5\pi}{2\cdot 13}\cos\dfrac{5\pi-3\pi}{2\cdot 13} \\
        &= 2\cos\dfrac{\pi}{13}\cdot\left[ \cos\dfrac{4\pi}{13} + \cos\dfrac{9\pi}{13} \right] \\
        &= 2\cos\dfrac{\pi}{13}\cdot\left[ 2\overbrace{\cos\dfrac{13\pi}{2\cdot 13}}^{\cos\frac{\pi}{2} = 0}\cos\dfrac{5\pi}{2\cdot 13}\right] \\
        &= 0
