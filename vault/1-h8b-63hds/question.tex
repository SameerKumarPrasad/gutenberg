% Now, down to brasstacks. ** Writing good solutions is an Art **. 
% Eventually, you will find your own style. But here are some thoughts 
% to get you started: 
%
%   1. Write to be understood - but be crisp. Your own solution should not take 
%      more space than you will give to the student. Hence, if you take more than 
%      a half-page to write a solution, then give the student a full-page and so on...
%
%   2. Use margin-notes to "talk" to students about the critical insights
%      in the question. The tone can be - in fact, should be - informal
%
%   3. Don't shy away from creating margin-figures you think will help
%      students understand. Yes, it is a little more work per question. 
%      But the question & solution will be written only once. Make that
%      attempt at writing a solution count.
%      
%      3b. Use bc_to_fig.tex. Its an easier way to generate plots & graphs 
% 
%   4. Ensure that there are *no spelling mistakes anywhere*. We are an 
%      education company. Bad spellings suggest that we ourselves 
%      don't have any education. Also, use American spellings by default
% 
%   5. If a question has multiple parts, then first delete lines 40-41
%   6. If a question does not have parts, then first delete lines 43-69
%   
%   7. Create versions of the question when possible. Use commands defined in 
%      tufte-tweaks.sty to do so. Its easier than you think

\question[2] In a certain city, all telephone numbers have six digits - with the first two digits
always being either $\vbone\vbtwo$ or $\vbone\vbthree$ or $\vbone\vbfour$ or $\vbfour\vbthree$ or 
$\vbfour\vbone$. Given this, how many telephone numbers have all six digits distinct?

\fi 

\begin{solution}[\mcq]
	There are 5 combinations for the first two numbers - each using two distinct digits. Hence, 
	for the whole telephone number to have all digits different, the next \textit{four} digits 
	must be anything other than the first two
	\begin{align}
		\Rightarrow N_{\texttt{total}} &= 5 \times \underbrace{(8 \times 7 \times 6 \times 5 )}_{\texttt{\# distinct combinations}}
		 = 8,400
	\end{align}
\end{solution}
