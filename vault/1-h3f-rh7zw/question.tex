% This is an empty shell file placed for you by the 'examiner' script.

% Now, down to brasstacks. ** Writing good solutions is an Art **. 
% Eventually, you will find your own style. But here are some thoughts 
% to get you started: 
%
%   1. Write the solution as if you are writing it for your favorite
%      14-17 year old to help him/her understand. Could be your nephew, 
%      your niece, a cousin perhaps or probably even you when you 
%      were that age. Just write for them.
%
%   2. Use margin-notes to "talk" to students about the critical insights
%      in the question. The tone can be - in fact, should be - informal
%
%   3. Don't shy away from creating margin-figures you think will help
%      students understand. Yes, it is a little more work per question. 
%      But the question & solution will be written only once. Make that
%      attempt at writing a solution count.
%
%   4. At the same time, do not be too verbose. A long solution can
%      - at first sight - make the student think, "God, that is a lot to know".
%      Our aim is not to scare students. Rather, our aim should be to 
%      create many "Aha!" moments everyday in classrooms around the world
% 
%   5. Ensure that there are *no spelling mistakes anywhere*. We are an 
%      education company. Bad spellings suggest that we ourselves 
%      don't have any education. Also, use American spellings by default
% 
%   6. If a question has multiple parts, then first delete lines 40-41
%   7. If a question does not have parts, then first delete lines 43-69

\question A metal sphere of diameter 42 cm is melted and drawn into a wire of diameter 28 cm.
What would be the length of the drawn wire if 20\% of the metal was lost during the melting process?

  % stuff to be shown only in the answer key - like explanatory margin figures
\fi 

\begin{solution}
  \begin{align}
    \text{Metal available after melting} &= \text{Volume of drawn wire} \\
    \Rightarrow 0.8\times\dfrac{4}{3}\pi\left(\dfrac{D_{sphere}}{2}\right)^3 &= 
    	\pi\left(\dfrac{D_{wire}}{2}\right)^2\cdot L_{wire} \\
    \Rightarrow L_{wire} &= \dfrac{1.6}{3}\times\dfrac{D_{sphere}^3}{D_{wire}^2} \\
                         &= \dfrac{1.6}{3}\times\dfrac{(42\text{cm})^3}{(28\text{cm})^2} \\
                         &= 50.4\text{ cm}
  \end{align}
\end{solution}
